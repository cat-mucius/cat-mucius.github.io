                  ИСТОРИИ ОРКОВ<BR>и сопутствующие материалы по истории Тьмы и 
                  расогенеза Арды<BR><BR><BR>Задачи и структура настоящей 
                  работы.<BR><BR>Наша цель - снабдить читателя, интересующегося 
                  историей и культурой орков, полным сводом фрагментов 
                  толкиеновского корпуса, имеющих отношение к этой проблеме. 
                  Фрагменты приводятся в общем порядке следования HME 1-12, 
                  Silmarillion, UT, LR: Appendices, прочие мелкие материалы, LR: 
                  основной текст, Hobbit. Этот порядок определяется 
                  последовательность издания серии HME и сравнительной важностью 
                  остальных материалов. Иногда параллельные фрагменты разных 
                  текстов приводятся рядом друг с другом.<BR><BR>Каждый фрагмент 
                  вводится номером и указанием источника, например: Fr.1. BLT 
                  1/3. /Lost Story III/ The Coming of Valar and the Building of 
                  Valinor, где вначале указывается в сокращенном виде том (см. 
                  список сокращений), а потом полностью сказание, входящее в 
                  него и содержащее фрагмент. Все тексты от составителя берутся 
                  в косые скобки / /; весь прочий текст принадлежит 
                  толкиеновскому корпусу. Пометка /Comm./ означает, что 
                  нижеследующий текст является комментарием Кристофера Толкиена 
                  с возможным включением пересказа или цитат текста 
                  Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена, помета /Rend./ означает, что нижеследующий 
                  текст является пересказом или изложением рукописи 
                  Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена, сделанным Кристофером Толкиеном, с элементами 
                  цитат подлинного текста Дж.Р.Р. или без таковых. Помета 
                  /Autocomm./ подразумевает попытку Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена понять и 
                  интерпретировать неясные ему самому стороны собственного мира; 
                  такие автокомментарии (учитывая, к тому же, неоднократные 
                  заявления Толкиена о том, что ему самому этот мир не вполне 
                  понятен и не особенно подвластен) не могут рассматриваться как 
                  «источники» по Арде. Толкиен выступает здесь не как «Толкиен», 
                  а как «толкиенист» - автор внешнего и гипотетического 
                  комментария к собственному тексту/миру. Тексты без помет (за 
                  исключением самоочевидных случаев) являются собственными 
                  текстами Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена «источникового» 
                  характера.<BR><BR>Особую проблему представляют собой указания 
                  страниц. Дело в том, что все толкиеновские тексты издавались 
                  неоднократно разными издательствами, как в большом формате, 
                  так и «пэйпербэками». Если сам текст Толкиена воспроизводится 
                  во всех изданиях совершенно одинаково, то распределение 
                  страниц, естественно, различное. Мало того, внутренние 
                  постраничные отсылки, содержащиеся в самом толкиеновском 
                  тексте, одни издания механически воспроизводят в их 
                  первоначальном виде, рассчитанном на пользование 
                  «Сильмариллионом» 1977 г. и Унвиновским первоизданием UT и HME 
                  в толстых переплетах, а другие пытаются их переправлять, 
                  отсылая к изданиям собственной серии и тем создавая безмерную 
                  путаницу. Я принял решение всюду, где можно, избегать ссылок 
                  на страницы, указывая вместо этого как можно точнее ту или 
                  иную часть текста; при крайней же необходимости указывать либо 
                  страницы унвиновского большеформатного издания (по умолчанию), 
                  либо страницы доступного иного издания (с указанием 
                  последнего). Тот, кто работает с любым изданием, легко сможет 
                  найти в нем нужную страницу, просто посмотрев по печатному 
                  индексу, на каких страницах указанной мной структурной части 
                  текста встречается ключевое слово фрагмента. Кроме того, если 
                  внутренняя ссылка дается на текст, который уже был приведен 
                  мной в качестве одного из фрагментов, я, как правило, привожу, 
                  наряду с номером страницы, номер соответствущего фрагмента в 
                  настоящем собрании. Вообще, настоящая сводка рассчитана прежде 
                  всего на то, чтобы ее и использовали, ссылаясь на номера 
                  фрагментов, а не на номера соответствующих страниц по какому 
                  бы то ни было изданию.<BR>Чем полезна работа такого типа? 
                  Прежде всего тем, что, загрузив ее и применяя простейший 
                  контекстный поиск, можно в течение 10 минут получить 
                  информацию, которую пришлось бы часами выбирать из печатных 
                  изданий (даже при условии, что все они у Вас есть). <BR><BR>В 
                  свою очередь, получив ее, можно довольно быстро решить 
                  проблемы, трудноразрешимые при обращении к отдельным текстам. 
                  Приведу только один пример: вопрос о соотношении «орков» и 
                  «гоблинов». Иногда эти термины выступают как совершенно 
                  совпадающие по смыслу обозначения орков; иногда - как 
                  обозначения двух разных, непересекающихся типов существ; 
                  иногда «орки» оказываются разновидностью «гоблинов». 
                  Сопоставление всех контекстов позволяет довольно быстро прийти 
                  к выводу о том, что<BR><BR>- 1. Самое раннее, еще нейтральное 
                  значение термина «гоблин» примерно совпадает со значением 
                  термина «фэй» - представители «малого народца», низшего 
                  мифологического уровня в целом. В этом смысле даже 
                  эльфы-нолдор оказываются «гоблинами», как о том прямо 
                  свидетельствует редкое употребление терминов «Gnome» и 
                  «goblin» как взаимозаменяемых (см. ниже, Fr.5)!<BR><BR>-2. В 
                  более узком и основном смысле первоначально гоблинами 
                  называлась всякая мелкая и средняя «нечисть» (точный перевод 
                  английского слова «гоблины» на русский язык) на службе 
                  Мелкора. Критерием выделения этой группы были относительно 
                  небольшие силы и размеры. Орки «сформировались» достаточно 
                  независимо от этих «гоблинов» и были крупнее и сильнее их, так 
                  что первоначально их строго различали.<BR><BR>- 2 &gt; 3. С 
                  другой стороны, орки были ненамного крупнее и сильнее, и 
                  достаточно походили на гоблинов с виду, чтобы при смешанных и 
                  совместных действиях восприниматься как их часть/часть некоего 
                  единства; возможно, они смешивались и физически и имели 
                  какие-то общие корни (например, в рамках общности «гоблинов» в 
                  первом, самом широком и нейтральном смысле слова). Тем самым 
                  орки стали восприниматься как часть/разновидность мелкоровых 
                  гоблинов (3).<BR><BR>- 3 &gt; 4. При этом, поскольку они были 
                  все-таки самыми сильными и, возможно, самыми многочисленными 
                  из «гоблинов» в этом новом, третьем смысле слова, они стали 
                  восприниматься еще и как главная их часть, «гоблины» par 
                  excellence (4). Тем самым термин «гоблин» начинает применяться 
                  как простое обозначение «орка».<BR><BR>- 4 &gt; 5. 
                  Впоследствии все прочие «гоблины» отошли в тень(не то вымерли, 
                  не то смешались с орками, не то вышли из всех конфликтов и так 
                  затаились, что больше их никакие источники не упоминают - во 
                  всяком случае, после Первой эпохи они полностью исчезают из 
                  текстов), и единственными «гоблинами» на виду источников 
                  остались «орки». Термин «гоблин» становится абсолютным 
                  синонимом к термину «орк» (5).<BR><BR>Заметим, что одинаковая 
                  принадлежность нолдор и орков к «гоблинам» в широком смысле 
                  слова (в словоупотреблении людей) согласуется с эльфийским 
                  происхождением орков, хотя и не подразумевает его 
                  категорически.<BR><BR>Толкиенисты с «историческим уклоном» (а 
                  есть и с литературным, и с литведческим, и с 
                  этико-философским, и с онтологическим, и с гносеологическим, и 
                  с географическим, и с антропологическим, и с лингвистическим - 
                  вот только с чисто естественнонаучным уклоном толкиенистов нет 
                  и быть не может, JRRT был гуманитарий и просто не оставил в 
                  этой области достаточно пищи для сердца и ума; все рассуждения 
                  на тему о возможных нейролингвистических и акустических 
                  механизмах речи у говорящих орлов или оптических свойствах 
                  палантиров были и останутся очень вымученными) весьма четко 
                  делятся на две - правда, пересекающиеся - категории. Одни 
                  радуются, когда начинают более цельно и живо представлять 
                  себе, что творилось - вернее, могло твориться - на душе у 
                  феанорингов, когда они шли громить Гавань Сириона. Это, так 
                  сказать, микроисторики от ардоведения. Если выяснится, как 
                  соотносятся друг с другом «гоблины», «гонги», «орки», 
                  «каукарелдар», «изначальные фэйри» и «злые фэйри», это их не 
                  огорчит и не обрадует. Другие радуются в точности таким вещам 
                  (третьи - тем и другим); это макроисторики, и именно для них 
                  предназначается данная работа.<BR><BR>В нижеследующий корпус 
                  включались фрагменты, помогающие выявить:<BR>место орков среди

                  интерпретировал и пытался применить в автокомментариях сам 
                  Толкиен.<BR><BR>P.S. Орки «Властелина Колец».<BR>Обычно 
                  «Властелин Колец» рассматривается чуть ли не как самый 
                  достоверный и подробный источник по облику и поведению 
                  различных рас Арды. Этот взгляд, при всей своей 
                  распространенности, не выдерживает ни малейшей критики. Что 
                  такое «ВК»? В пределах мира Толкиена это - сделанный самим 
                  Толкиеном перевод «Красной Книги Западной Марки», а точнее, 
                  романа, написанного неизвестными людьми Арнорско-Гондорского 
                  королевства на основе этой самой «Красной Книги», которая, в 
                  свою очередь, представляла собой компиляцию, основанную на 
                  записях Бильбо и Фродо, в течение столетий дополнявшихся и 
                  переправлявшихся как хоббитами Шира, так и гондорскими учеными 
                  (RFCG, s.v. Red Book of Westmarch). Тем самым настоящих 
                  голосов героев Войны Кольца мы в ВК вообще НЕ СЛЫШИМ и слышать 
                  не можем. Мыслимо ли, к примеру, чтобы Сэм точно зафиксировал 
                  в памяти все реплики Шаграта и Горбага, потом так же точно бы 
                  их надиктовал Фродо, тот так же точно их записал, а потом при 
                  многосотлетней переработке текста с ними ничего бы не 
                  случилось? Итак, все реплики орков (как и все конкретные 
                  реплики кого бы то ни было, как и вообще все, кроме сюжетной 
                  канвы) - это не стенограмма и не свидетельство очевидца, а 
                  "фукидидова речь" - то есть всего лишь реконструкция того, КАК 
                  И ЧТО МОГЛИ БЫ ГОВОРИТЬ ОРКИ ПО МНЕНИЮ "светлых" авторов и 
                  обработчиков исходных хоббитских записей. Ни подробного 
                  описания деталей, ни психологических характеристик, ни записей 
                  всех разговоров авторы первоисточника ВК - хоббиты "Братства" 
                  - составить и оставить не могли вообще, так что все это было 
                  досочинено и унифицировано потом - по существующим в уме 
                  авторов конечного ВК моделям. А эти модели предусматривали 
                  совершенно четкое отношение к оркам (которых к тому же те, кто 
                  писал орочьи диалоги ВК, уже несколько веков как не видели 
                  живьем). Портрет орков в ВК, сообщает нам нечто не об орках, а 
                  об авторах конечного ВК – о том, какими орков представляли 
                  себе эти «светлые» авторы сотни лет спустя. В этой связи 
                  весьма характерно, что уже «Хоббит» - текст, гораздо ближе 
                  стоящий к своему первоисточнику, то есть записям Бильбо - 
                  рисует орков куда более живо и в несколько ином свете, чем 
                  «ВК».<BR><BR>P.S.2. Орки на стороне Последнего Союза? 
                  <BR>Иногда это постулируют на основании, казалось бы, 
                  бесспорного пассажа из «Сильмариллиона», трактат «О Кольцах 
                  Власти и Третьей Эпохе»: /Во время войны Последнего Союза/ All 
                  living things were divided in that day, and some of every 
                  kind, even of beasts and birds, were found in either host, 
                  save the Elves only. They alone were undivided and followed 
                  Gil-galad. Казалось бы, отсюда следует, что во время Войны 
                  Последнего Союза разделились и орки; однако в письмах и эссе 
                  Толкиена разъяснения на эту тему выдержаны в том духе, что 
                  орки от начала и до конца служат Злу (Fr.170, Fr.252, Fr.260). 
                  Разгадка проста. В процитированном отрывке речь идет о позиции 
                  living things, «живых существ». Между тем в толкиеновском 
                  корпусе присутствует два несовместимых взгляда на орков по 
                  этому вопросу: по одному, это действительно живые существа 
                  (так, например, прямо в Fr.194, где орки причислены именно к 
                  living things), по другому - нечто вроде биороботов, 
                  псевдожизнь, созданная Мелкором, который настоящей жизни 
                  творить в принципе не мог (Fr. 26, 76, 103 и др.). 
                  Повествование «О Кольцах Власти...» (в отличие от других 
                  частей совершенно компилятивного итогового «Сильмариллиона», 
                  которые, к слову сказать, в вопросе о происхождении орков 
                  несогласны и друг с другом) исходит, несомненно, из второй 
                  концепции (чему есть и другие доказательства), и их «living 
                  things» просто не относится к оркам. Ср. об этом прямо: If any 
                  Orcs surrendered and asked for mercy, they must be granted it, 
                  even at a cost.** [**footnote to the text: Few Orcs ever did 
                  so in the Elder Days, and at no time would any Orc treat with 
                  any Elf], Fr.170, Orcs IIIa. Эта фраза полностью исключает 
                  участие орков в Последнем Союзе с эльфами. - Сравнительно 
                  недавно было высказано предположение, что орки все же имеются 
                  в виду в рассматриваемом пассаже в числе «живых существ», и 
                  что разделение распроняется и на них. Объяснять это, согласно 
                  автору указанного предположения, можно тем, что какая-то 
                  группа (группы) орков, не заключая, разумеется, союза с 
                  эльфами, могли выступать в союзе с определенным сообществом 
                  дварфов или людей (такие союзы и в самом деле зарегистрированы 
                  в источниках), а те, в свою очередь, по сугубо 
                  военно-политическим причинам могли, даже не блокируясь с 
                  Последним Союзом, а на свой страх и риск, вне какого-либо 
                  противостояния с Тьмой как целым, воевать с каким-то отрядом, 
                  принадлежащим к коалиции Саурона. Кроме того, орки могли 
                  воевать друг с другом, и вполне могло быть так, что одна из 
                  сталкивающихся групп орков входила в силы Саурона, а другая 
                  была самочстоятельна и жила на свой страх и риск. В 
                  приведенных выше ситуациях получилось бы, что какие-то орки 
                  «объективно» выступали против сил Саурона, что, по мысли 
                  авторов рассматриваемого предположения, и могло бы дать нашему 
                  источнику право распросранять представление о «разделившихся» 
                  во время Войны Последнего Союза существах и на орков. 
                  Согласиться с этим нельзя, так как процитированное выше место 
                  трактата «О Кольцах Власти и Третьей Эпохе» говорит не просто 
                  об «объективном» распределении сил, а о таком разделении 
                  каждой разновидности «живых существ» (кроме эльфов), при 
                  котором часть из них обнаруживалась в «каждом (из двух 
                  противоборствовавших) воинств» (host). Между тем ясно, что 
                  орки не могли присутствовать в «воинстве» (host) Последнего 
                  Союза (см. выше), а если какая-то группа орков и действовала 
                  против каких-то сил Саурона на свой страх и риск, не входя при 
                  этом в Воинство Последнего Союза, то этот факт в любом случае 
                  не учитывался бы и не покрывался рассматриваемой фразой 
                  трактата «О Кольцах Власти…»: последний учитывает только те 
                  случаи, когда одни представители одного и того же вида «living 
                  things» служили в одном из hosts (Гил-Галада - Элендила или 
                  Саурона), а другие – в другом. Остается считать, что 
                  составители трактата «О Кольцах власти» не числили орков среди 
                  «living things». <BR><BR>PS 3. Грудные орчата на воспитании у 
                  эльфов? <BR>Дм. Виноходов любезно сообщил нам следующее: 
                  «Листая старые подшивки эхо-конференции SU.TOLKIEN, я 
                  обнаружил в одном из посланий Андрея Ленского (ноябрь 1995 г.) 
                  цитату на английском языке с чрезвычайно интересной 
                  информацией. В письме было сказано, что цитата эта из письма 
                  Толкина, однако в сборнике писем я этого фрагмента не нашел, 
                  более того, сам Андрей уже не помнит, откуда он эту цитату 
                  взял. Никто из тех, к кому я обращался, не смог назвать 
                  источник цитаты. Были высказаны лишь предположения, что это 
                  цитата из какого-то руководства по играм. /.../ Вот эта 
                  цитата:<BR><BR>"...Female orcs are similar to males, and they 
                  often go to war with orc bands. Because they are shorter and 
                  thinner, most of them are snaga. Neither human nor orc from 
                  different tribe can distinguish them. Some of them carry 
                  children in backpacks. When orc with child is slain, other 
                  orcs kill child.<BR>...<BR>Littles [маленькие орчата, мать 
                  которых убили в бою - A/ндрей/ L/енский/] were often given to 
                  elves, and became elves themselves. But they have instinctive 
                  hatred to orcs, and elves could do nothing with 
                  it».<BR><BR>Огромное количество писем Толкиена в сборнике его 
                  писем не опубликовано, но в разные времена публиковались 
                  фрагментами в газетных и журнальных статях, комментаторами и в 
                  специальных журналах. Просмотреть все это и проверить таким 
                  образом, толкиеновская ли это цитата - совершенно невозможно. 
                  К.Кинн, стоявшая у истоков обсуждения этой цитаты еще в начале 
                  1990-х, указала нам, что это отрывок из англоязычного FAQ или 
                  из архивов англоязычной же конференции alt.tolkien конца 80-х 
                  - начала 90-х гг., причем присутствовала ли ссылка на «письмо 
                  Толкиена» там с самого начала и была ли она достоверна, 
                  неизвестно; таким образом, цитата может принадлежать и фэнам, 
                  и ролевикам. По экспертной оценке К.Кинн и Эли Бар-Яалома 
                  (Хатуля) текст не толкиеновский, и существует решающий 
                  аргумент в пользу такой оценки: в тексте стоит Because they 
                  (орчанки) are shorter and thinner, most of them are snaga. 
                  "Так как оркские самки ниже и тоньше самцов, большинство из 
                  них - снаги". Здесь "снага" - это экстерьерная категория 
                  орков, "особи определенного (меньшего) роста и массивности". 
                  Так мог бы понять Толкиена читатель при беглом восприятии его 
                  текста, но так никогда бы написал сам Толкиен: у него "снаги" 
                  - это определенные племена/породы (breeds) орков, 
                  характеризующиеся более низким ростом и меньшей массивностью - 
                  племена или породы, а не особи ( Fr.192)! Толкиен мог бы 
                  написать "большинство оркских самок - снаги, ибо они низки 
                  ростом и тонки" не с большей вероятностью, чем "большинство 
                  самок павлина - домашние куры, ибо не имеют разноцветных 
                  хвостов". Таким образом, цитата фэнская, а не толкиеновская, и 
                  мы не помещаем ее в корпус. (Задним числом можно найти и еще 
                  одно доказательство: если бы Толкиен считал эльфов столь 
                  благостными, он отразил бы это не раз и не два в самых разных 
                  текстах и разговорах /и Кристофер не преминул бы это 
                  упомянуть/, а не оставил бы столь ярко рисующую благородство 
                  эльфов черту для одноразового упоминания в 
                  неидентифицированном и не использованном его публикаторами

                  on awakening of Men /Rend./ <BR>/After awakening of Men by 
                  Elvenrulers Tuvo and Nuin/. At this point in the story the 
                  agents of Melko appear, the Uvanimor, 'bred in the earth' by 
                  him (Uvanimor, 'who are monsters, giants, and ogres', have 
                  been mentioned in an earlier tale, /HME 1/ pp. 75-6 /= Fr.1/); 
                  and Tuvo protected Men and Elves from them and from 'evil 
                  fays'. A makes mention of Orcs besides.<BR>A servant of Melko 
                  named 'Fukil or Fangli' entered the world, and coming among 
                  Men perverted them, so that they fell treacherously upon the 
                  Ilkorins; there followed the Battle of Palisor, in which the 
                  people of Ermon fought beside Nuin. According to A 'the fays 
                  and those Men that aided them were defeated', but B calls it 
                  an 'undecided battle', and the Men corrupted by Fangli fled 
                  away and became 'wild and savage tribes', worshipping Fangli 
                  and Melko. Thereafter (in A only) Palisor was possessed by 
                  'Fangli and his hosts of Nauglath (or Dwarves)'. (In the early 
                  writings the Dwarves are always portrayed as an evil people.) 
                  From this outline it is seen that the corruption of certain 
                  Men in the beginning of their days by the agency of Melko was 
                  a feature of the earliest phase of the mythology; but of all 
                  the story here sketched there is no more than a hint or 
                  suggestion, at most, in The Silmarillion (p. 141): ' "A 
                  darkness lies behind us," Beor said; "and we have turned our 
                  backs upon it, and we do not desire to return thither even in 
                  thought."<BR><BR>Fr.3<BR>/HME I. P.236-237/<BR>BLT 1/10. /Lost

                  Coming of Mankind.<BR>Later Outline (C+D) on awakening of Men 
                  /Rend. <BR>/.../ Here it is told at the beginning of the 
                  narrative that Melko's Uvanimor had escaped when the Gods 
                  broke the Fortress of the North, and were wandering in the 
                  forests; Fankil servant of Melko dwelt uncaptured in the 
                  world. (Fankil = Fangli /Fukil of A and B. In C he is called 
                  'child of Melko'. Fankil has been mentioned at an earlier 
                  point in D, when at the time of the Awakening of the Elves 
                  'Fankil and many dark shapes escaped into the world'; see 
                  /HME1/ p. 107, note 3) /.../ /After having been awakened by 
                  Elves/ Men dwelt in the centre of the world and spread thence 
                  in all directions; and a very great age passed. /Then/ Fankil 
                  with the Dwarves and Goblins went among Men, and bred 
                  estrangement between them and the Elves; and many Men aided 
                  the Dwarves. The folk of Ermon alone stood by the fairies in 
                  the first war of Goblins and Elves (Goblins is here an 
                  emendation from Dwarves, and that from Men), which is called 
                  the War of Palisor. Nuin died at the hands of the Goblins 
                  through the treachery of Men. Many kindreds of Men were driven 
                  to the eastern deserts and the southern forests, whence came 
                  dark and savage peoples.<BR><BR>Fr.4<BR>/HME I. P.239 + P.245, 
                  note 10/<BR>BLT 1/10. /Lost Story X/ Gilfanon’s Tale: The

                  Outlines (A, B) on the history of exiled Gnomes /Noldor/

                  Gondolin' and 'the estrangement of Men and Elves in Hisilome, 
                  owing to the Battle of Unnumbered Tears': Melko fostered 
                  distrust and kept them spying on each other, so that they 
                  should not combine against him; and he fashioned the 
                  false-fairies or Kaukareldar in their likeness, and these 
                  deceived and betrayed Men10.<BR>/.../ Note 10. The text has 
                  here the bracketed word '(Gongs)'. This might be thought to be 
                  a name for the Kaukareldar or 'false-fairies', but in the 
                  Gnomish word-list Gong is defined as ‘one of a tribe of the 
                  Orcs, a goblin'. /NB. Cf. Gong, Orc and Gorgun, druadainian

                  (HME 9)/3:(v). The theory of the work. <BR>/Numenorean Mannish 
                  Tradition/ <BR>There were 'Enkeladim' /Elves/ once on earth, 
                  but that was not their name in this world: it was Eledai (in 
                  Numenorean Eldar).(1) After the First Fall they tried to 
                  befriend Men, and teach them to love the Earth and all things 
                  that grow in it. But evil also was ever at work. There were 
                  false Eldar: counterfeits and deceits made by evil, ghosts and 
                  goblins, but not always evil to look at. They terrified Men, 
                  or else deceived and betrayed them, and hence arose the fear 
                  of Men for all the spirits of the Earth. <BR>Men 'awoke' first 
                  in the midst of the Great Middle Earth (Europe and Asia), and 
                  Asia was first thinly inhabited, before the Dark Ages of great 
                  cold. Even before that time Men had spread westward (and 
                  eastward) as far as the shores of the Sea. The [Enkeladim 
                  &gt;] Eledai withdrew into waste places or retreated 
                  westward.(2) The Men who journeyed westward were in general 
                  those who remained in closest touch with the true Eledai, and 
                  for the most part they were drawn west by the rumour of a land 
                  in or beyond the Western Sea which was beautiful, and was the 
                  home of the Eledai where all things were fair and ordered to 
                  beauty. This was so for there was a great island in the Ocean 
                  where the Eledai had first 'awakened' when the world was made: 
                  that is complete and ready for their operations. Thus it is 
                  that the more beautiful legends (containing truths) arose, of 
                  oreads, dryads, and nymphs; and of the Ljos-alfar.(3) 
                  <BR>NOTES. 1. The name Eledai occurs in Drowning of Anadune 
                  (and subsequent texts) §5 / Fr.41v/, as the name of the Nimri 
                  (Nimir) in their own language./.../ 2. Sketch I has here: 'The 
                  Great Central Land, Europe and Asia, was first inhabited. Men 
                  awoke in Mesopotamia. Their fates as they spread were very 
                  various. But the Enkeladim withdrew ever west.' 3. Ljos-alfar:

                  nigh rent the fur of his neck from him ere he was rescued by a 
                  host of Orcs that heard his cries.<BR><BR><BR>Fr.13<BR>/HME 2.

                  [3]. Miscellaneous Matters./<BR>(i) Morgoth. Beren addresses 
                  Melko as 'most mighty Belcha Morgoth', which are said to be 
                  his names among the Gnomes (/HME 2/ p. 44). In the Gnomish 
                  dictionary Belcha is-given as the Gnomish form corresponding 
                  to Melko (see /HME/ I. 260), but Morgoth is not found in it: 
                  indeed this is the first and only appearance of the name in 
                  the Lost Tales. The element goth is given in the Gnomish 
                  dictionary with the meaning 'war, strife'; but if Morgoth 
                  meant at this period 'Black Strife' it is perhaps strange that 
                  Beren should use it in a flattering speech. A name-list made 
                  in the 1930-s explains Morgoth as 'formed from his Orc-name 
                  Goth "Lord or Master" with mor "dark or black" prefixed', but 
                  it seems very doubtful that this etymology is valid for the 
                  earlier period. This name-list explains Gothmog 'Captain of 
                  Balrogs' as containing the same Orc-element ('Voice of Goth 
                  (Morgoth)'); but in the name-list to the tale of The Fall 
                  Condolin (p. 216) the name Gothmog is said to mean 
                  'Strife-and-hatred' (mog- 'detest, hate' appears in the 
                  Gnomish dictionary), which supports the interpretation of 
                  Morgoth in the present tale as 'Black 
                  Strife'.<BR><BR>Fr.14<BR>/HME 2. P.67/<BR>BLT2/1 Lost Story

                  wandering bands of the goblins and the Orcs' (/HME 2/ p. 14, 
                  retained in the typescript version), the terms are certainly 
                  synonymous in the Tale of Turambar /BLT 2/2 /. The Orcs are 
                  described in the present tale (ibid.) as 'foul broodlings of 
                  Melko'. In the second version (/HME 2/ p. 44) wolf-rider Orcs 
                  appear.<BR><BR>Fr.15<BR>/HME 2. P.76-78/<BR>BLT2/2 Lost Story

                  P.76/ Beleg the Elf and Turin the Man, which are not now told 
                  or remembered but which once were sung in many a place. With 
                  beast and with goblin they warred and fared at times into far 
                  places unknown to the Elves, and the fame of the hidden 
                  hunters of the marches began to be heard among Orcs and Elves. 
                  /...HME 2. P.77/ Nonetheless was Turin dragged now many an 
                  evil league in sore distress, a captive of the pitiless Orcs, 
                  and they made slow journeying, for they followed ever the line 
                  of dark hills toward those regions where they rise high and 
                  gloomy and their heads are shrouded in black vapours. There 
                  are they called Angorodin or the Iron Mountains, for beneath 
                  the roots of their northernmost fastnesses lies Angband, the 
                  Hells of Iron, most grievous of all abodes -- and thither were 
                  they now making laden with booty and with evil deeds./.../ 
                  Orcs and dragons and evil fays were loosed /by Melko/ against 
                  them /wild Elves and free Noldoli of Hithlum and the Lands 
                  Beyond/ and their lives were full of sorrow and travail. /.../ 
                  Now was it that it came into the heart of Beleg the hunter of 
                  the Elves to seek after Turin so soon as his own hurts were 
                  healed. This being done in no great number of days, for he had 
                  a skill of healing, he made all speed after the band of Orcs, 
                  and he had need of all his craft as tracker to follow that 
                  trail, for a band of the goblins of Melko go cunningly and 
                  very light. /...P.78/ Thus did it fall out that Belegbecame 
                  lost and benighted in a dark and perilous region so thick with 
                  pines of giant growth that none but the goblins might find a 
                  track, having eyes that pierced the deepest gloom, yet were 
                  many even of these lost long time in those regions; and they 
                  were called by the Noldoli Taurfuin, the Forest of Night.

                  ever they came to the spot that Flinding sought, they heard a 
                  shouting and a rough singing that was afar in the woods but 
                  drawing near; nor did they hide too soon ere the whole of that 
                  Orc-band passed nigh to them, and some of the captains were 
                  mounted upon small horses, and to one of these was Turin tied 
                  by the wrists so that he must trot or be dragged 
                  cruelly.<BR><BR>Fr.16a<BR>/HME 2. P.80/<BR>BLT2/2 Lost Story

                  awoke in fear. Now seeing a form bend over him in the gloom

                  was one of the Orcs come to slay him or to torment him -- and 
                  this they did often, cutting him with knives or hurting him 
                  with spears; but now Turin feeling his hand free leapt up and

                  leapt back and shouting out curses upon the goblins bid them

                  possessed with fear as she looked upon them, although she knew

                  ones before. Now did she turn and flee, but was espied, and 
                  one let fly a shaft at her that quivered suddenly in a tree 
                  beside her as she ran, and others seeing that it was a woman

                  /Glaurung, Glorund/. /Comm./<BR>(ix) The slaying of Clorund 
                  (pp. 103 -- 8). In this section I follow the narrative of the 
                  tale as far as Turin's swoon when the dying dragon opened his 
                  eyes and looked at him. Here the later story runs very close 
                  to the old, but there are many interesting differences. In the 
                  tale Glorund is said to have had bands of both Orcs and 
                  Noldoli subject to him / Fr.20/, but only the Orcs remained 
                  afterwards; cf. the Narn p. 125: Now the power and malice of 
                  Glaurung grew apace, and he waxed fat [cf. 'the Foaloke waxed 
                  fat'], and he gathered Orcs to him, and ruled as a 
                  dragon-King, and all the realm of Nargothrond that had been 
                  was laid under him / Fr.83b/.<BR><BR>Fr.22<BR>/HME 2. 
                  P.136/<BR>BLT2/2 Lost Story 2-2. /Comm./ /Rend./ Story of 
                  Nauglafring.<BR>Immediately following the rejected narrative 
                  there is a short outline headed 'Story of the Nauglafring or 
                  the Necklace of the Dwarves', and this also was struck 
                  through. Here there is no mention of Urin /Hurin/ at all, but 
                  it is told that the Orcs (emended from Gongs, see /HME/ I. 245 
                  note 10 / Fr.4, note/) who guarded the treasury of Glorund 
                  went in search of him when he did not come back to the caves, 
                  and in their absence Tintoglin (i.e. Tinwelint), learning of 
                  Glorund's death, sent Elves to steal thehoard of the Rothwarin 
                  (i.e. Rodothlim). The Orcs returning cursed the thieves, and 
                  they cursed the gold also. Linwe (i.e. Tinwelint) guarded the 
                  gold, and he had a great necklace made by certain Uvanimor 
                  (Nautar or Nauglath). (Uvanimor have been defined in an 
                  earlier tale as 'monsters, giants, and ogres', see /HME/ I. 
                  75, 236 /Frr.1,2/; Nauglath are Dwarves, /HME/ I. 236). In 
                  this Necklace the Silmaril was set; but the curse of the gold 
                  was on him, and he defrauded them of part of their reward. The 
                  Nauglath plotted, and got aid of Men; Linwe was slain in a 
                  raid, and the gold carried away.<BR><BR>Fr.23<BR>/HME 2. 
                  P.136/<BR>BLT2/2 Lost Story 2-2. /Comm./ /Rend./ The Necklace 
                  of the Dvarves /Cont.of Fr.22/<BR>There follows another 
                  rejected outline, headed 'The Necklace of the Dwarves', and 
                  this combines features of the preceding outline with features 
                  of the rejected ending of Eltas' narrative (pp. 135 -- 6). 
                  Here Urin gathers a band of Elves and Men who are wild and 
                  fierce, and they go to the caves, which are lightly guarded 
                  because the 'Orqui' (i.e. Orcs) are abroad seeking Glorund. 
                  They carry off the treasure, and the Orcs returning curse it. 
                  Urin casts the treasure before the king and reproaches him 
                  (saying that he might have sent a greater company to the caves 
                  to secure the treasure, if not to aid Mavwin in her distress); 
                  'Tintoglin would not touch it and bid Urin hold what he had 
                  won, but Urin would depart with bitter words'. Urin's men were 
                  not willing to leave it, and they sneaked back; there was an 
                  affray in the king's halls, and much blood was spilt on the 
                  gold. The outline concludes thus: The Gongs sack Linwe's halls 
                  and Linwe is slain and the gold is carried far away. Beren 
                  Ermabwed falls upon them at a crossing of Sirion and the 
                  treasure is cast into the water, and with it the Silmaril of 
                  Feanor. The Nauglath that dwell nigh dive after the gold but 
                  only one mighty necklace of gold (and that Silmaril is on it) 
                  do they find. This becomes a mark of their 
                  king.<BR><BR><BR>Fr.24<BR>/HME 2. P.156/<BR>BLT2/3 Lost Story

                  the evil of Melko and mingled among these Orcs, for all that 
                  race were bred by Melko of the subterranean heats and slime.

                  to the hills for the getting of ore, and straying in the 
                  mountains alone was taken by some of the Orcs prowling there, 
                  and they would do him evil and terrible hurt, knowing him to 
                  be a man of the Gondothlim.<BR>This was however unknown of 
                  Tuor's watchers. But evil came into the heart of Meglin, and 
                  he said to his captors: "Know then that I am Meglin son of Eol 
                  who had to wife Isfin sister of Turgon king of the 
                  Gondothlim." But they said: "What is that to us?" And Meglin 
                  answered: "Much is it to you; for if you slay me, be it speedy 
                  or slow, ye will lose great tidings concerning the city of 
                  Gondolin that your master would rejoice to hear." Then the 
                  Orcs stayed their hands, and said they would give him life if 
                  the matters he opened to them seemed to merit that; and Meglin 
                  told them of all the fashion of that plain and city, of its 
                  walls and their height and thickness, and the valour of its 
                  gates; of the host of men at arms who now obeyed Turgon he 
                  spake, and the countless hoard of weapons gathered for their 
                  equipment, of the engines of war and the venomous fires. 
                  <BR>Then the Orcs were wroth, and having heard these matters 
                  were yet for slaying him there and then as one who impudently 
                  enlarged the power of his miserable folk to the mockery of the 
                  great might and puissance of Melko; but Meglin catching at a 
                  straw said: "Think ye not that ye would rather pleasure your 
                  master if ye bore to his feet so noble a captive, that he 
                  might hear my tidings of himself and judge of their 
                  verity?"<BR>Now this seemed good to the Orcs, and they 
                  returned from the mountains about Gondolin to the Hills of 
                  Iron and the dark halls of Melko; thither they haled Meglin 
                  with them, and now was he in a sore dread. But when he knelt 
                  before the black throne of Melko in terror of the grimness of 
                  the shapes about him, of the wolves that sat beneath that 
                  chair and of the adders that twined about its legs, Melko bade 
                  him speak. Then told he those tidings, and Melko hearkening 
                  spake very fair to him, that the insolence of his heart in 
                  great measure returned. Now the end of this was that Melko 
                  aided by the cunning of Meglin devised a plan for the 
                  overthrow of Gondolin. For this Meglin's reward was to be a 
                  great captaincy among the Orcs - yet Melko purposed not in his 
                  heart to fulfil such a promise – but Tuor and Earendel should 
                  Melko burn, and Idril be given to Meglin's arms - and such 
                  promises was that evil one fain to redeem.Yet as meed of 
                  treachery did Melko threaten Meglin with the torment of the 
                  Balrogs. Now these were demons with whips of flame and claws 
                  of steel by whom he tormented those of the Noldoli who durst 
                  withstand him in anything -- and the Eldar have called them 
                  Malkarauki. But the rede that Meglin gave to Melko was that 
                  not all the host of the Orcs nor the Balrogs in their 
                  fierceness might by assault or siege hope ever to overthrow 
                  the walls and gates of Gondolin even if they availed to win 
                  unto the plain without. Therefore he counselled Melko to 
                  devise out of his sorceries a succour for his warriors in 
                  their endeavour. From the greatness of his wealth of metals 
                  and his powers of fire he bid him make beasts like snakes and 
                  dragons of irresistible might that should overcreep the 
                  Encircling Hills and lap that plain and its fair city in flame 
                  and death.<BR><BR>Fr.28<BR>/HME 2. P.170/<BR>BLT2/3 Lost Story 
                  2-3. The Fall of Gondolin.<BR>Then on a time Melko assembled 
                  all his most cunning smiths and sorcerers, and of iron and 
                  flame they wrought a host of monsters such as have only at 
                  that time been seen and shall not again be till the Great End. 
                  Some were all of iron so cunningly linked that they might flow 
                  like slow rivers of metal or coil themselves around and above 
                  all obstacles before them, and these were filled in their 
                  innermost depths with the grimmest of the Orcs with scimitars 
                  and spears; others of bronze and copper were given hearts and 
                  spirits of blazing fire, and they blasted all that stood 
                  before them with the terror of their snorting or trampled 
                  whatso escaped the ardour of their breath; yet others were 
                  creatures of pure flame that writhed like ropes of molten 
                  metal, and they brought to ruin whatever fabric they came 
                  nigh, and iron and stone melted before them and became as 
                  water, and upon them rode the Balrogs in hundreds; and these 
                  were the most dire of all those monsters which Melko devised 
                  against Gondolin.</FONT></P>

                  /Battle for Gondolin/ <BR>/HME 2. P.176/ ...an innumerable 
                  host of the Orcs, the goblins of hatred, poured therefrom into 
                  the breach; and who shall tell of the gleam of their scimitars 
                  or the flash of the broad-bladed spears with which they 
                  stabbed? /.../ There the blows of their /Elvish/ great hammers 
                  and the dint of their clubs rang to the Encircling Mountains 
                  and the Orcs fell like leaves; and those of the Swallow and 
                  the Arch poured arrows like the dark rains of autumn upon 
                  them, and both Orcs and Gondothlim fell thereunder for the 
                  smoke and the confusion. Great was that battle, yet for all 
                  their valour the Gondothlim by reason of the might of ever 
                  increasing numbers were borne slowly backwards till the 
                  goblins held part of the northernmost city. /.../ /HME 2. 
                  P.179-180/ Then Gothmog Lord of Balrogs gathered all his 
                  demons that were about the city... /...it is desribed later 
                  as/ ...an overwhelming force of the Orcs and the Balrogs... 
                  /.../ Now therefore Melko's goblins held all the gate /.../ 
                  Then on a sudden their music ceased and Ecthelion of the fair 
                  voice shouted for the drawing of swords, and before the Orcs 
                  might foresee his onslaught the flashing of those pale blades 
                  was amongst them. 'Tis said that Ecthelion's folk there slew 
                  more of the goblins than fell ever in all the battles of the 
                  Eldalie with that race, and that his name is a terror among 
                  them to this latest day, and a warcry to the Eldar. /.../ /HME 
                  2. P.181/ /.../ There Tuor slew Othrod a lord of the Orcs 
                  cleaving his helm, and Balcmeg he hewed asunder, and Lug he 
                  smote with his axe that his limbs were cut from beneath him at 
                  the knee, but Ecthelion shore through two captains of the 
                  goblins at a sweep and cleft the head of Orcobal their 
                  chiefest champion to his teeth; and by reason of the great 
                  doughtiness of those two lords they came even unto the 
                  Balrogs. /.../ /HME 2. P.183/ But now the men of Melko have 
                  assembled their forces, and seven dragons of fire are come 
                  with Orcs about them and Balrogs upon them down all the ways 
                  from north, east, and west, seeking the Square of the King. 
                  .../ /HME 2. P.185/ /In full defeat/ There he /Turgon/ shouted 
                  in a voice like a horn blown among the mountains, and all that 
                  were gathered beneath the Trees and the foemen in the mists of 
                  the square heard him: "Great is the victory of the Noldoli!" 
                  And 'tis said that it was then middle night, and that the Orcs 
                  yelled in derision. .../ /HME 2. P.186/ Lo! a drake was coiled 
                  even on the very steps of the palace and defiled their 
                  whiteness; but swarms of the Orcs ransacked within and dragged 
                  forth forgotten women and children or slew men that fought

                  Orcs (or Orqui as they were called in Tuor A, and in Tuor B as 
                  first written): 'all that race were bred of the subterranean 
                  heats and slime.' There is no trace yet of the later view that 
                  'naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance of life, 
                  could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the Ainulindale 
                  before the Beginning', or that the Orcs were derived from 
                  enslaved Quendi after the Awakening (The Silmarillion p. 50). 
                  Conceivably there is a first hint of this idea of their origin 
                  in the words of the tale in the same passage: 'unless it be 
                  that certain of,the Noldoli were twisted to the evil of Melko 
                  and mingled among these Orcs', although of course this is as 
                  it stands quite distinct from the idea that the Orcs were 
                  actually bred from Elves. Here also occurs the name Glamhoth 
                  of the Orcs, a name that reappears in the later Tuor (pp. 39 
                  and 54 note 18).<BR><BR>Fr.35<BR>/HME 2. P.224/<BR>BLT2/4 Lost

                  a good wage, and the pleasure of their Master moreover, and a 
                  rich booty at the end; and all these he armed with his own

                  Dwarves/ held the bridge, and there was war within the 
                  cavernous gates. Then did those Orcs and Dwarves ransack all

                  as terrible of the Orcs and Indrafangs fell with death and 
                  fire upon all the realm of Tinwelint. /.../ Indeed the tale 
                  tells that even as that host of the Orcs were burning all the 
                  land of Tinwelint and the Nauglath and the Indrafangin were 
                  wending homeward burdened utterly with spoils of gold and 
                  precious things /.../ how the hunting party had been 
                  surrounded and o'erwhelmed by the Nauglath while the 
                  Indrafangs and Orcs fell suddenly with death and fire upon all

                  /Comm./<BR>But however much the chief actors in this tale are 
                  'enspelled' or blindly carrying forward the mysterious 
                  dictates of a curse, there is no question but that the Dwarves 
                  in the original conception were altogether more ignoble than 
                  they afterwards became, more prone to evil to gain their ends, 
                  and more exclusively impelled by greed; that Doriath should be 
                  laid waste by mercenary Orcs under Dwarvish paymasters (/HME 
                  2/ p. 230 / Fr.36/) was to become incredible and impossible 
                  later. It is even said that by the deeds of Naugladur 'have 
                  the Dwarves been severed in feud for ever since those days 
                  with the Elves, and drawn more nigh in friendship to the kin 
                  of Melko' (/HME 2/ p. 230); and in the outlines for Gilfanon's 
                  Tale the Nauglath are an evil people, associates of goblins 
                  (/HME/ I. P.236- 7). In a rejected outline for the Tale of the 
                  Nauglafring (/HME 2/ p. 136 / Fr.22/) the Necklace was made 
                  'by certain Uvanimor (Nautar or Nauglath)', Uvanimor being 
                  defined elsewhere as 'monsters, giants, and ogres' / Fr.1/. 
                  With all this compare The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F (I): 
                  'They [the Dwarves] are not evil by nature, and few ever 
                  served the Enemy of free will, whatever the tales of Men may 
                  have alleged'.<BR><BR>Fr.39<BR>/HME 2. P.283-288/<BR>BLT2/5

                  the Golden Book takes up the Tale: one of the children of the 
                  fathers of the fathers of Men. [Against this is written:] It 
                  may perhaps be much better to let Eriol himself see the last 
                  things and finish the book. Rising of the Lost Elves against 
                  the Orcs and Nautar. /.../ The Battle of Ros: the Island-elves 
                  and the Lost Elves against Nautar, Gongs, Orcs, and a few evil 
                  Men. Defeat of the Elves. The fading Elves retire to Tol 
                  Eressea /=Britain/ and hide in the woods. Men come to Tol 
                  Eressea /which changes i.e. into England at last/ and also 
                  Orcs, Dwarves, Gongs, Trolls, etc. After the Battle of Ros the 
                  Elves faded with sorrow. They cannot live in air breathed by a 
                  number of Men equal to their own or greater; and ever as Men 
                  wax more powerful and numerous so the fairies fade and grow 
                  small and tenuous, filmy and transparent, but Men larger and 
                  more dense and gross. At last Men, or almost all, can no 
                  longer see the fairies. The Gods now dwell in Valinor, and 
                  come scarcely ever to the world, being content with the 
                  restraining of the elements from utterly destroying Men. They 
                  grieve much at what they see; but Iluvatar is over all. 
                  /P.284/ On the page opposite the passage about the Battle of 
                  Ros is written: A great battle between Men at the Heath of the 
                  Sky-roof (now the Withered Heath), about a league from 
                  Tavrobel. The Elves and the Children flee over the Gruir and 
                  the Afros.<BR>/Comm./ <BR>/P.285/ Precisely who are to be 
                  understood by the 'Lost Elves' is not clear; but in Gilfanon's 
                  Tale (I. 231) all Elves of the Great Lands 'that never saw the 
                  light at Kor' (Ilkorins), whether or not they left the Waters 
                  of Awakening, are called 'the lost fairies of the world', and 
                  this seems likely to be the meaning here. It must then be 
                  supposed that there dwelt on Tol Eressea only the Eldar of Kor 
                  (the 'Exiles') and the Noldoli released from thraldom under 
                  Melko /.../ The word Nautar occurs in a rejected outline for 
                  the Tale of the Nauglafring (/HME 2/ p. 136), where it is 
                  equated with Nauglath (Dwarves) .Gongs: these are evil beings 
                  obscurely related to Orcs: see /HME/ I. 245 note 10 / Fr.4,

                  -lim in Orclim see Condothlim.) The entry for Balrog in NFG 
                  says: 'Bal meaneth evilness, and Balc evil, and Balrog meaneth 
                  evil demon.' GL has balc 'cruel'. see /HME/ I. 250

                  'folk of dreadful hate', p. 160). For Goldothrim see I. 262 
                  (Noldoli). The first element is glam 'hatred, loathing'; other 
                  words are glamri 'bitter feud', glamog 'loathsome'. An entry

                  Морготом, но имманентно присущими Арде как ее необходимая 
                  часть «духами природы» (сf. Йарвен во «Властелине», в котором 
                  можно с наибольшей вероятностью видеть крупнейшего 
                  представителя этой категории существ - «Хозяина мира», 
                  воплощенного духа-всей-Арды-в-целом, причем, как было 
                  остроумно предположено недавно, Арды в ее изначальном, 
                  «неискаженном» состоянии). Как видно из того, что люди могли 
                  смешивать этих фэйри с эльфами в одну категорию «народа тени» 
                  или включать их в число эльфов как таковых (ср. ниже 
                  применение термина Shadow Folk одинаково к тем и другим 
                  обитателям Хисиломе и вообще отождествление людьми множества 
                  ардианских духов с эльфами), внешне от эльфов они ничем не 
                  отличались, что позволяет гипотетически выводить из их среды и 
                  эльфов, и особенно другие сходные расы, включая орков. Cf. 
                  also Fr.2, 4, 4a, 15; Fr.58, l.2132; Fr.112, 132 on bogeys, 
                  228a-d; cf. одинаковое эльфийское наименование орков и 
                  балрогов *«рауко» с общим значением «демон» (аналогичнo 
                  «гоблину», как называли и орков, и прочую нечисть, и нолдор)! 
                  Поскольку, по наиболее архаическим и наименее тенденциозным 
                  изводам эльфийской мифологии, орки появились еще до 
                  «Пробуждения» эльфов и людей, и при этом отличаются всеми 
                  источниками от животных, этих исходных орков остается либо 
                  выводить из общности указанных исходных «фэйри» 
                  (естественнонаучный выбор), либо считать псевдожизнью, 
                  кремниевыми биороботами, созданными Мелкором (одна из 
                  теологических версий, представленная мифом о творении орков 
                  Мелкором из камня).<BR>Подробнее о фэйри и о происхождении

                  текст под названием "Из айнур в фэйри: фэйри Арды - от 
                  Бомбадила до древнейших орков".<BR><BR>a. BLT1/5. /Lost Story 
                  V/. The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kor. /HME 1. 
                  P.118-119/.<BR>Grievous had been their /Elvish/ march /to the 
                  shores of Great Sea on the rout to Valinor/, and dark and 
                  difficult the way through Hisilome the land of shade, despite 
                  the skill and power of Orome. Indeed long after the joy of 
                  Valinor had washed its memory faint the Elves sang still sadly 
                  of it, and told tales of many of their folk whom they aid and 
                  say were lost in those old forests and ever wandered there in 
                  sorrow. Still were they there long after when Men were shut in 
                  Hisilome by Melko, and still do they dance there when Men have 
                  wandered far over the lighter places of the Earth. Hisilome 
                  did Men name Aryador, and the Lost Elves did they call the 
                  Shadow Folk, and feared them.<BR>b. BLT1/9. /Lost Story IX/. 
                  The Hiding of Valinor. /HME 1. P.215/.<BR>Now at first the 
                  Valar purposed to draw the Sun and Moon beneath the 
                  Earth.../.../ and much precious radiance was spilled in their 
                  attempts about the deepest waters, and escaped to linger as 
                  secret sparks in many an unknown ocean cavern. These have many 
                  elfin divers, and divers of the fays, long time sought beyond 
                  the outmost East.<BR>c. BLT 1/10. /Lost Story X/ Gilfanon’s 
                  Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of Mankind. 
                  Earlier Outlines (A, B) on the History of the Exiled Gnomes 
                  /Rend./ /HME 1. P.237/.<BR>The Gnomes, after the passage of 
                  Helkarakse, spread into Hisilome, whew they bad 'trouble' with 
                  the ancient Shadow Folk in that land -- in A called 
                  'fay-people', in B 'Uvalear fays'. (We have met the Shadow 
                  Folk of Hisilome before, in the tale of The Coming of the 
                  Elves, p. 118-119, but there this is a name given by Men, 
                  after they were shut in Hisilome by Melko, to the Lost Elves 
                  who remained there after straying on the march from Palisor. 
                  It will be seen in the later outlines that these Shadow Folk 
                  were an unknown people wholly distinct from Elves; and it 
                  seems therefore that the name was preserved while given a new 
                  interpretation).<BR>d. BLT 1/10. /Lost Story X/ Gilfanon’s 
                  Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of Mankind. 
                  Later Outlines (A, B) on the History of the Exiled Gnomes 
                  /Rend./ /HME 1. P.239/.<BR>The Gnomes sojourned in the Land of 
                  Shadows (i.e. Hisilome), and had dealings with the Shadow 
                  Folk. These were fays (C); no one knows whence they came: they 
                  are not of the Valar nor of Melko, but it is thought that they 
                  came from the outer void and primeval dark when the world was 
                  first fashioned.<BR>cf. e. BLT 2/1. /Comm./ /HME 2. 
                  P.63-64/.<BR>In The Coming of the Elves (/HME/ I.115) 'Tinwe 
                  abode not long with his people, and yet 'tis said lives still 
                  lord of the scattered Elves of Hisilome'; and in the same tale 
                  (/HME/ I. 118-19) the 'Lost Elves' were still there 'long 
                  after when Men were shut in Hisilome by Melko', and Men called 
                  them the Shadow Folk, and feared them. But in the Tale of 
                  Tinuviel the conception has changed. Tinwelint is now a king 
                  ruling, not in Hisilome, but in Artanor.*<BR>*In the outlines 
                  for Gilfanon's Tale the 'Shadow Folk' of Hisilome have ceased 
                  to be Elves and become 'fays' whose origin is unknown: /HME/

                  was built, and she wandered in the wooded places of the world, 
                  and nightingales went with her and often sang about her. /.../

                  even on them and live.<BR>g-5. BLT2/1 Lost Story 2-I. The Tale 
                  of Tinuviel. Then did Tinuviel begin such a dance as neither

                  The Tale of Tinuviel. Long, long after, as thou knowest, Melko 
                  brake again into the world from Valinor, and all the Eldar 
                  both those who remained in the dark or had been lost upon the 
                  march from Palisor and those Noldoli too who fared back into 
                  the world after him seeking their stolen treasury fell beneath 
                  his power as thralls. Yet it is told that many there were who 
                  escaped and wandered in the woods and empty places, and of 
                  these many a wild and woodland clan rallied beneath King 
                  Tinwelint. Of those the most were Ilkorindi -which is to say 
                  Eldar that never had beheld Valinor or the Two Trees or dwelt 
                  in Kor -- and eerie they were and strange beings, knowing 
                  little of light or loveliness or of musics save it be dark 
                  songs and chantings of a rugged wonder that faded in the 
                  wooded places or echoed in deep caves. Different indeed did 
                  they become when the Sun arose, and indeed before that already 
                  were their numbers mingled with a many wandering Gnomes, and 
                  wayward sprites too there were of Lorien's host that dwelt in 
                  the courts of Tinwelint, being followers of Gwendeling, and 
                  these were not of the kindreds of the Eldalie.<BR>h. LsR 
                  (HME5)/3. The Etymologies.<BR>THUR- surround, fence, ward,

                  secret shadow, Doriathren name (Noldor. Dolwethil) assumed by 
                  Tinuviel as a bat-shaped fay [+WATH /shade/]. [Cf. the Lay of 
                  Leithian /HME 3/3/, line 3954, where a marginal note explains 
                  Thuringwethil as 'she of hidden shadow' (/HME/ 3. P. 297, 
                  304). The present entry retains the story of the Lay: it was 
                  Luthien who called herself by this name before Morgoth (see 
                  /HME/ 3. 306)]. <BR>i. BLT 1 (HME 1)/3. /Lost Story III/ The

                  in uproar with their passing, there came still hurrying late 
                  Makar and his fierce sister Measse; and it had been better had 
                  they not found the world but remained for ever with the Ainur 
                  beyond Vaitya and the stars, for both were spirits of 
                  quarrelsome mood, and with some other lesser ones who came now 
                  with them had been the first and chief to join in the discords 
                  of Melko and to aid in the spreading of his music. /../

                  wrapped dark and sluggish about the world and without it, but

                  came they to Vilna that is grey and therein may the birds fly 
                  safely.With them came many of those lesser Vali who loved them 
                  and had played nigh them and attuned their music to theirs, 
                  and these are the Manir and the Suruli, the sylphs of the airs

                  Aule and Yavanna to Middle-Earth before the Construction of 
                  the Lamps/ ...but with Aule was that great lady Palurien whose 
                  delights were richness and fruits of the earth, for which 
                  reason has she long been called Yavanna among the Eldar.About 
                  them fared a great host who are the sprites of trees and 
                  woods, of dale and forest and mountain-side, or those- that 
                  sing amid the grass at morning and chant among the standing 
                  corn at eve. These are the Nermir and the Tavari, Nandini and 
                  Orossi, brownies, fays, pixies, leprawns, and what else are 
                  they not called, for their number is very great: yet must they 
                  not be confused with the Eldar, for they were born before the 
                  world and are older than its oldest, and are not of it, but 
                  laugh at it much, for had they not somewhat to do with its 
                  making, so that it is for the most part a play for them; but 
                  the Eldar are of the world and love it with a great and 
                  burning love, and are wistful in all their happiness for that 
                  reason.<BR>/Comm./ Particularly interesting is the passage 
                  concerning the host of lesser spirits who accompanied Aule and 
                  Palurien, from which one sees how old is the conception of the 
                  Eldar as quite dissimilar in essential nature from 'brownies, 
                  fays, pixies, leprawns', since the Eldar are 'of the world' 
                  and bound to it, whereas those others are beings from before 
                  the world's making. In the later work there is no trace of any 
                  such explanation of the 'pixie' element in the world's 
                  population: the Maiar are little referred to, and certainly 
                  not said to include such beings as 'sing amid the grass at 
                  morning and chant among the standing corn at eve'.*<BR>* Cf. 
                  The Silmarillion p. 30: 'With the Valar came other spirits 
                  whose being also began before the world, of the same order as 
                  the Valar but of less degree. These are the Maiar, the people 
                  of the Valar, and their servants and helpers. Their number is 
                  not known to the Elves, and few have names in any of the 
                  tongues of the Children of Iluvatar.' An earlier version of 
                  this passage reads: 'Many lesser spirits they [the Valar] 
                  brought in their train, both great and small, and some of 
                  these Men have confused with the Eldar or Elves; but wrongly, 
                  for they were before the world, but Elves and Men awoke first 
                  in the world after the coming of the Valar.'<BR>j. BLT 1 (HME 
                  1)/4. The chaining of Melko.<BR>That night Eriol heard again 
                  in his sleep the music that had so moved him on the first 
                  night; and the next morning he went again into the gardens 
                  early. There he met Vaire, and she called him Eriol: 'that was 
                  the first making and uttering of that name'. Eriol told Vaire 
                  of the 'dream-musics' he had heard, and she said that it was 
                  no dream-music, but rather the flute of Timpinen, 'whom those 
                  Gnomes Rumil and Little- heart and others of my house call 
                  Tinfang'. She told him that the children called him Tinfang 
                  Warble; and that he played and danced in summer dusks for joy 
                  of the first stars: 'at every note a new one sparkles forth 
                  and glisters. The Noldoli say that they come out too soon if 
                  Tinfang Warble plays, and they love him, and the children will 
                  watch often from the windows lest he tread the shadowy lawns 
                  unseen.' She told Eriol that he was 'shier than a fawn -- 
                  swift to hide and dart away as any vole: a footstep on a twig 
                  and he is away, and his fluting will come mocking from afar'. 
                  'And a marvel of wizardry liveth in that fluting,' said Eriol, 
                  'if that it be indeed which I have heard now for two nights 
                  here. 'There be none,' said Vaire, 'not even of the Solosimpi, 
                  who can rival him therein, albeit those same pipers claim him 
                  as their kin; yet 'tis said everywhere that this quaint spirit 
                  is neither wholly of the Valar nor of the Eldar, but is half a 
                  fay of the woods and dells, one of the great companies of the 
                  children of Palurien, and half a Gnome or a Shoreland Piper.' 
                  Howso that be he is a wondrous wise and strange creature, and 
                  he fared hither away with the Eldar long ago, marching nor 
                  resting among them but going always ahead piping strangely or 
                  whiles sitting aloof. Now does he play about the gardens of 
                  the land; but Alalminore he loves the best, and this garden 
                  best of all. Ever and again we miss his piping for long 
                  months, and we say: "Tinfang Warble has gone heart-breaking in 
                  the Great Lands, and many a one in those far regions will hear 
                  his piping in the dusk outside tonight." <BR>/Comm./ In the 
                  earliest version Tinfang is called a 'leprawn', and in the 
                  early glossary of the Gnomish speech he is a 'fay'. <BR>k. BLT

                  destruction but before Elves’ Awakening/ Then Palurien Yavanna 
                  fared forth from her fruitful gardens to survey the wide lands 
                  of her domain, and wandered the dark continents sowing seed 
                  and brooding upon hill and dale. /.../. Now was Orome less 
                  gloomy and Palurien was comforted, seeing the beauty of the 
                  first stars of Varda /.../ At that time did many strange 
                  spirits fare into the world, for there were pleasant places 
                  dark and quiet for them to dwell in. Some came from Mandos, 
                  aged spirits that journeyed from Iluvatar with him who are 
                  older than the world and very gloomy and secret, and some from 
                  the fortresses of the North where Melko then dwelt in the deep 
                  dungeons of Utumna. Full of evil and unwholesome were they; 
                  luring and restlessness and horror they brought, turning the 
                  dark into an ill and fearful thing, which it was not before. 
                  But some few danced thither with gentle feet exuding evening 
                  scents, and these came from the gardens of Lorien. Still is 
                  the world full of these in the days of light, lingering alone 
                  in shadowy hearts of primeval forests, calling secret things 
                  across a starry waste, and haunting caverns in the hills that 
                  few have found: -- but the pinewoods are yet too full of these 
                  old unelfin and inhuman spirits for the quietude of Eldar or

                  yet many are the ways whereby they find the outer world from 
                  time to time -- from fissures where they shriek with the 
                  voices of the tide on rocky coasts, down dark water-ways that

                  of Valinor /AV 1/. Comm. to engl.translation.<BR>This is not a 
                  version, but a single page of manuscript with first, a 
                  different beginning to the Annals of Valinor in Modern 
                  English, and then ten lines, written very rapidly, in Old 
                  English. Both contain interesting features. The first reads as 
                  follows: In what is said here concerning the lesser spirits of 
                  Valarin race there are differences from AV (/HME 4/ p. 311) 
                  and the Old English version II (/HME 4/ p. 340). In this 
                  present fragment these spirits are not called Valarindi but 
                  Vanimor, 'the Fair'. The Children of the Valar, 'who were many 
                  and very beautiful', are counted among the Vanimor, but, in 
                  contradiction to AV, they were «on worolde acende», 'born in 
                  the world'. At this time, it seems, my father was tending to 
                  emphasize the generative powers of the great Valar, though 
                  afterwards all trace of the conception disappeared.<BR>r. LsR 
                  (HME5)/2:2. The Later Annals of Valinor /AV 2/<BR>/beginning 
                  section/ <BR>With these great ones /Valar/ came many lesser 
                  spirits, beings of their own kind but of smaller might; these 
                  are the Vanimor, the Beautiful. And with them also were later 
                  numbered their children, begotten in the world, but of divine 
                  race, who were many and fair; these are the Valarindi. 
                  <BR>/Comm. to beginning section/. This is associated with 
                  development in the idea of the lesser beings who came into the 
                  world with the Valar, which underwent several changes 
                  (ultimately emerging into the conception of the Maiar). In Q 
                  (/HME/ IV. 78) these spirits are mentioned but not given any 
                  name, and the same remains the case in QS (§2). In AV 1 (/HME/ 
                  IV. 263) a distinction is made between the children of the 
                  Valar on the one hand and 'beings of their own kind but of 
                  less might' on the other; but all entered the world with the 
                  Valar, and all are called Valarindi. In AV 2 the distinction 
                  is enlarged: the lesser spirits, 'beings of their own kind but 
                  of smaller might', who came with the Valar, are the Vanimor, 
                  'the Beautiful', and the Children of the Valar, who did not 
                  enter the world with them but were begotten in the world, are 
                  the Valarindi; these were 'later numbered with' the Vanimor. 
                  In the Old English fragment referred to above the same is 
                  said, though the name Valarindi is not there given to the 
                  Children of the Valar (/HME/ IV. 293). <BR>s. LsR (HME5)/2:6. 
                  Quenta Silmarillion /QS/. [§1-2]<BR>[§1] /...Eru/ showed the 
                  World to the Ainur. And many of the mightiest of them became 
                  enamoured of its beauty, and desired to enter into it; and 
                  they put on the raiment of the World, and descended into it, 
                  and they are in it. [§2]. These spirits the Elves name the 
                  Valar, which is the Powers, and Men have often called them 
                  Gods. Many lesser spirits of their own kind they brought in 
                  their train, both great and small; and some of these Men have 
                  confused with the Elves, but wrongly, for they were made 
                  before the World, whereas Elves and Men awoke first in the 
                  World, after the coming of the Valar. Yet in the making of 
                  Elves and of Men, and in the giving to each of their especial 
                  gifts, none of the Valar had any part. Iluvatar alone was 
                  their author; wherefore they are called the Children of 
                  Iluvatar.</FONT></P>

                  Last Tales. The Fall of Numenor. [§5-6]<BR>[§5] /At the very 
                  beginning of the Second Age the Dark creatures of Middle-Earth 
                  threatend its peoples/. Therefore the hearts of the Eruhin 
                  /Eru’s Children/ were turned westward, where was the land of 
                  Aman, as they believed, and an abiding peace. And it is said 
                  that of old there was a fair folk dwelling yet in 
                  Middle-earth, and Men knew not whence they came. But some said 
                  that they were the children of the Avaloi /Valar, Gods/ and 
                  did not die, for their home was in the Blessed Realm far away, 
                  whither they still might go, and whence they came, working the 
                  will of Aman in all the lesser deeds and labours of the world. 
                  The Eledai they were named in their own tongue of old, but by 
                  the Eruhin they were called Nimri, the Shining Ones, for they 
                  were exceeding fair to look upon, and fair were all the works 
                  of their tongues and hands. And the Nimri became sorrowful in 
                  the darkness of the days and withdrew ever westward; and never 
                  again was grass so green, nor flower so fair, nor water so 
                  filled with light when they had gone. And the Eruhin for the 
                  most part followed them, though some there were that remained 
                  in the Great Lands, free men, serving no evil lord; and they 
                  were shepherds and dwelt far from the towers and cities of the 
                  kings. [§6] But those of the Eruhin who were mightiest and 
                  most fair, closest in friendship with the Nimri, most beloved 
                  by the Servants of God, turned their faces to the light of the 
                  West /.../ And at the end of journeys beyond memory they came 
                  at last to the shores of the Great Seas. There they halted and 
                  were filled with great dread, and with longing; for the Nimri 
                  passed ever over the waters, seeking the land of Aman, and the 
                  Eruhin could not follow them. Then such of the Nimri as 
                  remained in the west of the world took pity on the Eruhin, and 
                  instructed them in many arts.<BR>/Comm. to §5/. In §16 the 
                  Nimri are called, without any qualification of 'some said', 
                  'the children of the Deathless Folk'. Cf. the opening of the 
                  Quenta Silmarillion (/HME/ V.204, §2): «These spirits the 
                  Elves name the Valar, which is the Powers, and Men have often 
                  called them Gods. Many lesser spirits of their own kind they 
                  brought in their train, both great and small; and some of 
                  these Men have confused with the Elves, but wrongly, for they 
                  were made before the World, whereas Elves and Men awoke first 
                  in the World, after the coming of the Valar». Though not 
                  mentioned in this passage, the conception of 'the Children of 
                  the Valar' is frequently encountered in the Quenta 
                  Silmarillion; and cf. especially The Later Annals of Valinor 
                  (V.110): 'With these great ones came many lesser spirits, 
                  beings of their own kind but of smaller might... And with them 
                  also were later numbered their children...' /.../ Eledai: this 
                  name is found elsewhere.<BR>w. MR (HME 10)/3:1:1. The The 
                  Later Quenta Silmarillion. The First Phase. Of the Valar. [§2] 
                  These spirits the Elves name the Valar, which is the Powers, 
                  and Men have often called them gods. Many lesser spirits of 
                  their own kind they brought in their train, both great and 
                  small; and some of these Men have confused with the Elves, but 
                  wrongfully [read wrongly], for they were made before the 
                  World, whereas Elves and Men awoke first on Earth, after the 
                  coming of the Valar. Yet in the making of Elves and of Men, 
                  and in the giving to each of their especial gifts, none of the 
                  Valar had any part. Iluvatar alone was their author; wherefore 
                  they are called the Children of Iluvatar [&gt; Eru].<BR>y.

                  among these spirits the Elves name the Valar, the Powers of 
                  Arda, and Men have often called them gods. The Lords of the 
                  Valar are seven; and the Valier, the Queens of the Valar, are 
                  seven also.<BR>z. Silmarillion-1977. Valaquenta. Of the

                  began before the World, of the same order as the Valar but of 
                  less degree. These are the Maiar, the people of the Valar, and 
                  their servants and helpers. Their number is not known to the 
                  Elves, and few have names in any of the tongues of the 
                  Children of Iluvatar; for though it is otherwise in Aman, in 
                  Middle-earth the Maiar have seldom appeared in form visible to 
                  Elves and Men.<BR>aa. Silmarillion-1977. Quenta Silmarillion

                  монолог принадлежит не оркам, а Саурону/Тху, допрашивающему 
                  героев на Тол-Гаурхот, «Острове веревольфов». Действительно, 
                  продолжение этой речи (со стк.2143) заведомо принадлежит Тху. 
                  Однако искреннее вожделение, проявляемое в цитированном 
                  отрывке по отношению к Лэтиэн (совершенно немыслимое для майа, 
                  а равно, хотя и по другим причинам, для веревольфов), которое 
                  говорящий не только высказывает от своего лица, но даже 
                  предполагает за вала Мелкором (!), в сочетании с переходом от 
                  2-го лица по отношению к «Неребу» в стк. 2117 -2136 к 3-му в 
                  стк. 2137-2142 («Нереб выглядит разъяренным /при словах о 
                  Лэтиэн/ ... что беспокоит его?» и т.д.) и затем опять ко 2-му 
                  в отрывке стк.2143 слл. («Кому вы служите, Свету или Мраку?» и 
                  т.д.), а также с резким перепадом речи в этом отрывке 
                  (стк.2143 слл.) по сравнению с предыдущим (стк.2117-2136) от 
                  примитивно-солдатской к высокой и эмфатизированной и по 
                  тематике, и по стилю, побуждает нас считать, что в 
                  стк.2117-2136 «орков Нереба» допрашивает еще не сам Тху, а 
                  некие антропоморфные его подчиненные существенно более низкого 
                  статуса, то есть, вернее всего, служащие при нем орки же; 
                  затем, в стк.2137-2142 передаются мысли, посетившие Тху при 
                  этом допросе, и только со стк.2143 - его собственные слова, 
                  начиная с того момента, как он, под воздействием этих мыслей, 
                  вступил в разговор сам (чем и объясняется как перепад лица в 
                  промежутке между двумя отрывками прямой речи, так и контраст 
                  характера самих этих отрывков).<BR><BR>Fr.59<BR>LB (HME 3)/3.

                  and all Angband was empty. There came wolves and serpents, and 
                  there came Balrogs like fire, and there came the first of all 
                  the dragons, the eldest of all the Worms of Greed. Glomund was 
                  his name and long had his terror been noised abroad, though he

                  breath was the death of many. And they were driven in the end 
                  far away, and the Gorge of Aglon was filled with Orcs and the 
                  hill of Himling with the people of Morgoth.<BR>cf. b. LsR

                  let loose his last strength, and hell was emptied. There came 
                  wolves and serpents, and there came Balrogs one thousand, and 
                  there came Glomund the Father of Dragons. And the strength and 
                  terror of the Worm were now grown very great; and Elves and 
                  Men withered before him. Thus Morgoth hindered the joining of 
                  the hosts of the Elves; yet he would not have achieved this, 
                  neither with Balrog nor Dragon, had the captains of the 
                  Easterlings remained true. Many of these men now turned and 
                  fled; but the sons of Ulfang went over to the side of Morgoth 
                  /.../ From that day the hearts of the Elves were estranged 
                  from Men, save only from those of the Three Houses /.../ 
                  [§16]. Thus the design of Morgoth was fulfilled in a manner 
                  after his own heart; for Men took the lives of Men, and 
                  betrayed the Elves, and fear and hatred were aroused among 
                  those who should have been united against him /.../; and the 
                  Gorge of Aglon was filled with Orcs, and the Hill of Himring 
                  garrisoned by the soldiers of Angband, and the gates of the 
                  land were in the power of Morgoth.<BR>cf. c. WJ (HME11)/1. The 
                  Grey Annals (The Annals of the Beleriand). /GA1+GA2/<BR>472 
                  Year of Sun. /Nirnaeth Arnoedidad/<BR>[§230]. But even as the 
                  vanguard of Maidros came upon the Orcs, Morgoth loosed his 
                  last strength, and Angband was emptied. There came wolves, and 
                  wolfriders, and there came Balrogs a thousand, and there came 
                  worms and drakes, and Glaurung, Father of Dragons. And the 
                  strength and terror of the Great Worm were now grown great 
                  indeed, and Elves and Men withered before him; and he came 
                  between the hosts of Maidros and Fingon and swept them apart. 
                  [§231]. Yet neither by wolf, balrog, nor dragon would Morgoth 
                  have achieved his end, but for the treachery of Men 
                  /Easterlings under Ulfangings/. /.../ But new strength of evil 
                  men came up that Uldor had summoned and kept hidden in the 
                  eastern hills, and the host of Maidros being assailed now on 
                  three sides, by the Orcs, and the beasts, and by the Swarthy 
                  Men, was dispersed and fled this way and that. /.../ [§242]. 
                  The March of Maidros was no more. /.../ The Gorge of Aglon was 
                  filled with Orcs, and the Hill of Himring was garrisoned by 
                  soldiers of Angband.<BR>cf. d. Silmarillion-1977. Quenta 
                  Silmarillion /Silmarillion/. 20. Of the Fifth Battle. Nirnaeth 
                  Arnoedidad.<BR>Some have said that even then the Eldar might 
                  have won the day, had all their hosts proved faithful; for the 
                  Orcs wavered, and their onslaught was stayed, and already some 
                  were turning to flight. But even as the vanguard of Maedhros 
                  came upon the Orcs, Morgoth loosed his last strength, and 
                  Angband was emptied. There came wolves, and wolfriders, and 
                  there came Balrogs, and dragons, and Glaurung father of 
                  dragons. The strength and terror of the Great Worm were now 
                  great indeed, and Elves and Men withered before him; and he 
                  came between the hosts of Maedhros and Fingon and swept them 
                  apart.<BR>Yet neither by wolf, nor by Balrog, nor by Dragon, 
                  would Morgoth have achieved his end, but for the treachery of 
                  Men. /.../ and the host of Maedhros was assailed now on three 
                  sides, and it broke, and was scattered, and fled this way and 
                  that. Yet /.../ gathering a remnant of the Noldor and the 
                  Naugrim about them they hewed a way out of the battle and 
                  escaped far away towards Mount Dolmed in the east.<BR>/.../ 
                  But now in the western battle Fingon and Turgon were assailed 
                  by a tide of foes thrice greater than all the force that was 
                  left to them. Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, high-captain of 
                  Angband, was come /.../. At last Fingon stood alone with his 
                  guard dead about him; and he fought with Gothmog, until 
                  another Balrog came behind and cast a thong of fire about him. 
                  Then Gothmog hewed him with his black axe, and a white flame 
                  sprang up from the helm of Fingon as it was cloven. Thus fell 
                  the High King of the Noldor; and they beat him into the dust 
                  with their maces, and his banner, blue and silver, they trod 
                  into the mire of his blood.<BR>/.../ All the valiant Men of 
                  Hador were slain about him in a heap; and the Orcs hewed their 
                  heads and piled them as a mound of gold in the 
                  sunset.<BR>/.../ The Orcs and the wolves went freely through 
                  all the North, and came ever further -southward into

                  were swept away like shrivelled leaves before a burning wind. 
                  Few remained to trouble the world thereafter. And Morgoth 
                  himself came forth, and all his dragons were about him; and 
                  Fionwe for a moment was driven back. But the sons of the Valar 
                  in the end overthrew them all, and but two escaped. Morgoth 
                  escaped not.<BR>Cf. b. ShME (HME 4)/3. The Quenta /Quenta 
                  Noldorinwa/, /Q/. [§18, Var.II = §18 in Q II version]. <BR>The 
                  meeting of the hosts of the West and of the North is named the 
                  Great Battle, the Battle Terrible, the Battle of Wrath and 
                  Thunder. There was marshalled the whole power of the Throne of 
                  Hate, and well nigh measureless had it become, so that 
                  Dor-na-Fauglith could not contain it, and all the North was 
                  aflame with war. But it availed not. All the Balrogs were 
                  destroyed, and the uncounted hosts of the Orcs perished like 
                  straw in fire, or were swept like shrivelled leaves before a 
                  burning wind. Few remained to trouble the world thereafter. 
                  And it is said that there many Men of Hithlum repentant of 
                  their evil servitude did deeds of valour, and many beside of 
                  Men new come out of the East; and so were fulfilled in part 
                  the words of Ulmo; for by Earendel son of Tuor was help 
                  brought unto the Elves, and by the swords of Men were they 
                  strengthened on the fields of war. /cf. Fr.86/ But Morgoth 
                  quailed and he came not forth; and he loosed his last assault, 
                  and that was the winged dragons. So sudden and so swift and 
                  ruinous was the onset of that fleet, as a tempest of a hundred 
                  thunders winged with steel, that Fionwe was driven back; but 
                  Earendel came and a myriad of birds were about him, and the 
                  battle lasted all through the night of doubt. And Earendel 
                  slew Ancalagon the black and the mightiest of all the 
                  dragon-horde, and cast him from the sky, and in his fall the 
                  towers of Thangorodrim were thrown down. Then the sun rose of 
                  the second day and the sons' of the Valar prevailed, and all 
                  the dragons were destroyed save two alone; and they fled into 
                  the East. Then were all the pits of Morgoth broken and 
                  unroofed, and the might of Fionwe descended into the deeps of 
                  the Earth, and there Morgoth was thrown down.<BR>c. LsR

                  [550]. <BR>Here Fionwe fought the last battle of the ancient 
                  world, the Great or Terrible Battle. /Orcs are strikingly not 
                  mentioned by their own name, but, as comparison of wording 
                  shows, just as «hosts of Morgoth»!/ Morgoth himself came forth 
                  from Angband, and passed over Taur-na-Fuin, and the thunder of 
                  his approach rolled in the mountains. The waters of Sirion lay 
                  between the hosts; and long and bitterly they contested the 
                  passage. But Fionwe crossed Sirion and the hosts of Morgoth 
                  were driven as leaves, and the Balrogs were utterly destroyed; 
                  and Morgoth fled back to Angband pursued by Fionwe. From 
                  Angband Morgoth loosed the winged dragons, which had not 
                  before been seen; and Fionwe was beaten back upon 
                  Dor-na-Fauglith. But Earendel came in the sky and overthrew 
                  Ancalagon the Black Dragon, and in his fall Thangorodrim was 
                  broken. The sons of the Gods wrestled with Morgoth in his 
                  dungeons /.../ Morgoth was bound. This war lasted fifty years

                  the whole power of the Throne of Morgoth, and it had become 
                  great beyond count, so that Dor-na-Fauglith could not contain 
                  it, and all the North was aflame with war. But it availed not. 
                  The Balrogs were destroyed, save some few that fled and hid 
                  themselves in caverns inaccessible at the roots of the earth.

                  Fionwe and the sons of the Valar returned to Valmar and told 
                  of all the things that had been done. Thereafter the Hither 
                  Lands of Middle-earth should be for Mankind, the younger

                  Commentary on the Annals of Beleriand (AB 1). 
                  /Comm./<BR>/Commentary on the beginning of Annals/ <BR>There 
                  is here the remarkable statement that Morgoth 'devises the 
                  Balrogs and the Orcs', implying that it was only now that they 
                  came into being. In Q (§2) /= Fr.76/, following S /= Fr.68/, 
                  they originated (if the Balrogs were not already in existence) 
                  in the ancient darkness after the overthrow of the Lamps, and 
                  when Morgoth returned to Angband 'countless became the number 
                  of the hosts of his Orcs and demons' (§4) /= Fr.77/; similarly 
                  in AV 1/= Fr.89/ he 'bred and gathered once more his evil 
                  servants, Orcs and Balrogs'. A note written against the 
                  passage in Q § 4 /= Fr.77, note 8/ directs, however, that the 
                  making of the Orcs should be brought in here rather than 
                  earlier: and in the version of 'The Silmarillion' that 
                  followed Q (later than these Annals) this was in fact done: 
                  «when Morgoth returned, countless became the hosts of his 
                  beasts and demons; and he brought into being the race of the 
                  Orcs, and they grew and multiplied in the bowels of the 
                  earth». (The subsequent elaboration of the origin of the Orcs 
                  is extremely complex and cannot be entered into here.) It is 
                  clear, therefore, that these words in AB 1, despite the fact 
                  of its being evidently earlier than AV 1, look forward to the 
                  later idea (itself impermanent) that the Orcs were not made 
                  until after Morgoth's return from Valinor.<BR>Fr.93<BR>LsR

                  when Fionwe son of Manwe overthrew Morgoth and rescued the 
                  Exiles, the three houses of the Men of Beleriand fought 
                  against Morgoth. But most Men were allies of the Enemy; and 
                  after the victory of the Lords of the West those that were not 
                  destroyed fled eastward into Middle-earth; and the servants of 
                  Morgoth that escaped came to them, and enslaved them. For the 
                  Gods forsook for a time the Men of Middle-earth, because they 
                  had disobeyed their summons and hearkened to the Enemy. And 
                  Men were troubled by many evil things that Morgoth had made in 
                  the days of his dominion: demons and dragons and monsters, and 
                  Orcs, that are mockeries of the creatures of Iluvatar; and 
                  their lot was unhappy. /.../ Yet his /Morgoth’s/ Will 
                  remaineth, and guideth his servants; and it moveth them ever

                  many of his servants, spirits of evil, whom his will governed

                  <BR>a. [§8]<BR>The speech of the Gnomes was influenced also 
                  much by that of the Ilkorins of Beleriand, and somewhat by 
                  tongues of the eldest Men, and a little even by the speech of 
                  Angband and of the Orcs. Though they were never far estranged, 
                  there came thus also to be differences in speech among the 
                  Noldor themselves, and the kinds are accounted five: the 
                  speech of Mithrim and of Fingolfin'sfolk; and the speech of 
                  Gondolin and the people of Turgon; the speech of Nargothrond 
                  and the house and folk of Felagund and his brothers; and the 
                  speech of Himring and the sons of Feanor; and the corrupted 
                  speech of the thrall-Gnomes, spoken by the Noldor that were 
                  held captive in Angband, or compelled to the service of 
                  Morgoth and the Orcs. /NB. Note that the Orcs are presented 
                  here syntaxically as Morgoth’s contragents and cousers of 
                  others’ service, not as servants themselves!/. Most of these 
                  /Noldor mentioned above/ perished in the wars of the North, 
                  and ere the end was left only mulanoldorin [molanoldorin], or 
                  the language of the thralls, and the language of Gondolin, 
                  where the ancient tongue was kept most pure.<BR>b. 
                  [§9]<BR>Orquin, or Orquian, the language of the Orcs, the 
                  soldiers and creatures of Morgoth, was partly itself of Valian 
                  origin, for it was derived from the Vala Morgoth. But the 
                  speech which he taught he perverted wilfully to evil, as he 
                  did all things, and the language of the Orcs was hideous and 
                  foul and utterly unlike the languages of the Qendi. But 
                  Morgoth himself spoke all tongues with power and beauty, when 
                  so he wished.<BR>/Comm. on Lhammas B, §9/. There appears here 
                  the first account of the origin of the Orc-speech: a wilful 
                  perversion of Valian speech by Morgoth. <BR>c. [§10] <BR>The 
                  languages of Men were from their beginning diverse and 
                  various; yet they were for the most part derived remotely from 
                  the language of the Valar. For the Dark-elves, various folk of 
                  the Lembi /=Avari/, befriended wandering Men in sundry times 
                  and places in the most ancient days, and taught them such 
                  things as they knew. But other Men learned also wholly or in 
                  part of the Orcs and of the Dwarves; while in the West ere 
                  they came into Beleriand the fair houses of the eldest Men 
                  learned of the Danas, or Green-elves.<BR>d. Lhammas A /quoted

                  described: ‘For the Dark-elves... befriended wandering Men... 
                  and taught them such as they knew; and in the passing of the

                  (but no direct 'descent') /.../.<BR><BR>Fr.101, a-c.<BR>a. LsR

                  its Descendants. <BR>[§9]<BR>Of the language of the Dwarves 
                  little is known to us, save that its origin is as dark as is 
                  the origin of the Dwarvish race itself; and their tongues are 
                  not akin to other tongues, but wholly alien, and they are 
                  harsh and intricate, and few have essayed to learn them. (Thus 
                  saith Rumil in his writings concerning the speeches of the 
                  earth of old, but I, Pengolod, have heard it said by some that 
                  Aule first made the Dwarves, longing for the coming of Elves 
                  and Men, and desiring those to whom he could teach his crafts 
                  and wisdom. And he thought in his heart that he could 
                  forestall Iluvatar. But the Dwarves have no spirit indwelling, 
                  as have Elves and Men, the Children of Iluvatar, and this the 
                  Valar cannot give. Therefore the Dwarves have skill and craft, 
                  but no art, and they make no poetry. Aule devised a speech for 
                  them afresh, for his delight [is] in invention, and it has 
                  therefore no kinship with others; and they have made this 
                  harsh in use. Their tongues are, therefore, Aulian; and 
                  survive yet in a few places with the Dwarves in Middle-earth, 
                  and besides that the languages of Men are derived in part from 
                  them.)<BR>/Comm. on Lhammas B, §9/. The legend of Aule's 
                  making of the Dwarves has appeared in AB 2 (annal 104), in a 
                  passage strikingly similar to the present, and containing the 
                  same phrase 'the Dwarves have no spirit indwelling'.<BR>b. LsR 
                  (HME5)/2:3. The Later Annals of Beleriand /AB 2/. <BR>Year 104 
                  [154].<BR>About this time the Gnomes climbed Eredlindon and 
                  gazed eastward, but they did not pass into the lands beyond. 
                  In those mountains the folk of Cranthir came first upon the 
                  Dwarves, and there was yet no enmity between them, and 
                  nonetheless little love. It was not known in those days whence 
                  the Dwarves had origin, save that they were not of Elf-kin or 
                  of mortal kind, nor yet of Morgoth's breeding. But it is said 
                  by some of the wise in Valinor, as I have since learned," that 
                  Aule made the Dwarves long ago, desiring the coming of the 
                  Elves and of Men, for he wished to have learners to whom he 
                  could teach his crafts of hand, and he could not wait upon the 
                  designs of Iluvatar. But the Dwarves have no spirit 
                  indwelling, as have the Children of the Creator, and they have 
                  skill but not art; and they go back into the stone of the 
                  mountains of which they were made.<BR>c. WJ (HME11)/2:13. The 
                  Later Quenta Silmarillion /LQ 1 + LQ 2/. Concerning the 
                  Dwarves.<BR>[§2]. The Naugrim are not of Elf-kind, nor of 
                  Man-kind, nor yet of Melkor's breeding; and the Noldor in 
                  Middle-earth knew not whence they came, holding that they were 
                  alien to the Children, albeit in many ways like unto them. But 
                  in Valinor the wise have learned that the Dwarves were made in 
                  secret by Aule, while Earth was yet dark; for he desired the 
                  coming of the Children of Iluvatar, that he might have 
                  learners to whom he could teach his crafts and lore, and he 
                  was unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of 
                  Iluvatar. Wherefore, though the Dwarves are like the Orcs in 
                  this: that they came of the wilfulness of one of the Valar, 
                  they are not evil; for they were not made out of malice in 
                  mockery of the Children, but came of the desire of Aule's 
                  heart to make things of his own after the pattern of the 
                  designs of Iluvatar. And since they came in the days of the 
                  power of Melkor, Aule made them strong to endure. Therefore 
                  they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship and in 
                  enmity, and they suffer toil and hunger and hurt of body more 
                  hardily than all other speaking-folk. And they live long, far 
                  beyond the span of Men, and yet not for ever. Aforetime the 
                  Noldor held that dying they returned unto the earth and the 
                  stone of which they were made; yet that is not their own 
                  belief. For they say that Aule cares for them and gathers them 
                  in Mandos in halls set apart for them, and there they wait, 
                  not in idleness but in the practice of crafts and the learning 
                  of yet deeper lore. And Aule, they say, declared to their 
                  Fathers of old that Iluvatar had accepted from him the work of 
                  his desire, and that Iluvatar will hallow them and give them a 
                  place among the Children in the End. Then their part shall be 
                  to serve Aule and to aid him in the remaking of Arda after the 
                  Last Battle.<BR><BR>Fr.102<BR>LsR (HME5)/2:6. Quenta

                  of his creatures: their hearts were of fire, and they had 
                  whips of flame. The Gnomes in later days named them Balrogs. 
                  But in that time Morgoth made many monsters of divers kinds 
                  and shapes that long troubled the world; yet the Orcs were not 
                  made until he had looked upon the Elves, and he made them in 
                  mockery of the Children of Iluvatar.<BR>/Draft of this 
                  passage, quoted and commented in Comm. on Chapter 3(a), §18/ 
                  The original text of the passage concerning the demons of 
                  Morgoth ran as follows: ‘... in the North Morgoth built his 
                  strength, and gathered his demon-broods about him, whom the 
                  Gnomes after knew as Balrogs: they had whips of flame. The 
                  Uvanimor he made, monsters of divers kinds and shapes; but the 
                  Orcs were not made until he had looked upon the Elves’. The 
                  term Uvanimor occurs in the Lost Tales, /HME/ 1. 75 
                  ('monsters, giants, and ogres') / Fr.1/, etc.; cf. Vanimor' 
                  the Beautiful'. /.../ On the question of when the Orcs first 
                  came into being see /HME 5/ p. 148 / Fr.96:Comm./ and 
                  commentary on QS §62 / Fr.103a/. It is said in The Fall 
                  of.Numenor II (§1) / Fr.93/ that the Orcs are 'mockeries of 
                  the creatures of Iluvatar' (cf. also The Lost Road, /HME 5/ p. 
                  65 / Fr.94/). In QS §62 / Fr.103a/ the idea that the Orcs were 
                  mockeries of the Elves is found in the text as originally 
                  written.</FONT></P>

                  /QS/. Chapter 5.<BR>[§62]<BR>/Aftermath of the Trees’ 
                  destruction and the fight with Ungoliant/. Thus Morgoth came 
                  back to his ancient habitation, and he built anew his vaults 
                  and dungeons and great towers, in that place which the Gnomes 
                  after knew as Angband. There countless became the hosts of his 
                  beasts and demons; and he brought into being the race of the 
                  Orcs, and they grew and multiplied in the bowels of the earth. 
                  These Orcs Morgoth made in envy and mockery of the Elves, and 
                  they were made of stone, but their hearts of hatred. Glamhoth, 
                  the hosts of hate, the Gnomes have called them. Goblins they 
                  may be called, but in ancient days they were strong and fell. 
                  <BR>Comm. on Chapter 5, §62.<BR>Q has 'To his aid came the 
                  Orcs and Balrogs that lived yet in the lowest places of 
                  Angband', but Orcs are absent here in QS. /.../ In Q the 
                  passage about Morgoth's making of the Orcs, precursor of this 
                  in QS, is placed earlier (/HME/ IV.82 / Fr.76), before the 
                  making of the stars and the awakening of the Elves; at the 
                  corresponding place in QS (§ 18) / Fr.102/ it is said that 
                  'the Orcs were not made until he had looked upon the Elves.' 
                  In Q, at the place (/HME/ IV. 93 / Fr.77/) corresponding to 
                  the present passage in QS, it is said that 'countless became 
                  the number of the hosts of his Orcs and demons' - i.e. the 
                  Orcs were already in existence before Morgoth's return (and so 
                  could come to his aid when they heard his cry); but there is a 
                  direction in Q at this point (/HME/ IV. 93 note 8 / Fr.77, 
                  note 8/) to bring in the making of the Orcs here rather than 
                  earlier (the reason for this being the idea that the Orcs were 
                  made 'in mockery of the Children of Iluvatar').<BR>b. RSh 
                  (HME6)/10. The Attack on Weathertop.<BR>Note 9 to The Attack 
                  on Weathertop. /.../ There are other very roughly written 
                  texts giving a resume of a part of 'The Silmarillion' <BR>But 
                  Morgoth, the greatest of the Powers, made war upon the Gods, 
                  and he destroyed the Trees, and fled. And he took with him the 
                  immortal gems, the Silmarils, that were made by the Elves of 
                  the light of the Trees, and in which alone now the ancient 
                  radiance of the days of bliss remained. In the north of the 
                  Middle-earth he set up his throne Angband, the Halls of Iron 
                  under Thangorodrim the Mountain of Thunder; and he grew in 
                  strength and darkness; and he brought forth the Orcs and 
                  goblins, and the Balrogs, demons of fire. But the High Elves 
                  of the West forsook the land of the Gods and returned to the 
                  earth, and made war upon him to regain the jewels.<BR>/Comm./ 
                  Very curious is the statement here that when Morgoth returned 
                  to Middle-earth after the destruction of the Trees 'he brought 
                  forth the Orcs and goblins, and the Balrogs, demons of fire.' 
                  It was certainly my father's view at this period that the Orcs 
                  were then first engendered (see V. 233, §62 and commentary / 
                  Fr.103a/), but the Balrogs were far older in their beginning 
                  (V. 212, §18 / Fr.102/), and indeed came to rescue Morgoth 
                  from Ungoliante at the time of his return: 'to his aid there 
                  came the Balrogs that lived yet in the deepest places of his 
                  ancient fortress.'<BR><BR>Fr.104<BR>LsR (HME5)/2:6. Quenta

                  Silmarillion /QS/. Chapter 10.<BR>[§122-123]<BR>[§122] For 
                  though the Dwarfs did not serve Morgoth, yet they were in some 
                  things more like to his people than to the Elves. /.../ [§123] 
                  The Naugrim were not of the Elf-race nor of mortal kind, nor 
                  yet of Morgoth's breeding; and in those days the Gnomes knew 
                  not whence they came. [But it is said by the wise in Valinor, 
                  as we have learned since, that Aule made the Dwarfs while the 
                  world was yet dark, desiring the coming of the Children of 
                  Iluvatar, that he might have learners to whom he could teach 
                  his lore and craft, and being unwilling to await the 
                  fulfilment of the designs of Iluvatar. Wherefore the Dwarfs 
                  are like the Orcs in this, that they come of the wilfulness of 
                  one of the Valar; but they were not made out of malice and 
                  mockery, and were not begotten of evil purpose. Yet they 
                  derive their thought and being after their measure from only 
                  one of the Powers, whereas Elves and Men, to whomsoever among 
                  the Valar they chiefly turn, have kinship with all in some 
                  degree. Therefore the works of the Dwarfs have great skill, 
                  but small beauty, save where they imitate the arts of the 
                  Eldar; and the Dwarfs return unto the earth and the stone of 
                  the hills of which they were fashioned]. /../ They /the 
                  Dwarfs/ aided the Gnomes greatly in their war with the Orcs of 
                  Morgoth ; but it is not thought that they would have refused 
                  to smithy also for Morgoth, if he had had need of their work, 
                  or had been open to their trade.<BR>Comm. on Chapter 10, §122. 
                  It is remarkable that at this time the statement that the 
                  Dwarves were 'in some things more like to Morgoth's people 
                  than to the Elves' still survived from Q (IV. 104); but this 
                  is now palliated by what is said in §123, where the likeness 
                  of the Dwarves to the Orcs is represented only as an analogous 
                  limitation of natural powers consequent on their origins.

                  obviously Gandalf/ <BR>In the very ancient days the Ring-lord 
                  made many of these Rings: and sent them out through the world 
                  to snare people. He sent them to all sorts of folk - the Elves 
                  had many, and there are now many elfwraiths in the world, but 
                  the Ring-lord cannot rule them; the goblins got many, and the 
                  invisible goblins are very evil and wholly under the Lord; 
                  dwarves I don't believe had any; some say the rings don't work 
                  on them: they are too solid. Men had few, but they were most 
                  quickly overcome and. /.../ Other creatures got them. Do you 
                  remember Bilbo's story of Gollum? (7) We don't know where 
                  Gollum comes in - certainly not elf, nor goblin; he is 
                  probably not dwarf; we rather believe he really belongs to an 
                  ancient sort of hobbit.<BR>Note 7. After this sentence my 
                  father wrote: 'Gollum I think some sort of distant kinsman of 
                  the goblin sort.' Since this is contradicted in the next 
                  sentence it was obviously rejected in the act of writing; he 
                  crossed it out later.<BR>/Version II. Gandalf’s speech/ 'The 
                  elves had many, and there are now many elf-wraiths in the 
                  world; the goblins had some and their wraiths are very evil 
                  and wholly under the command of the Lord. /.../ They /Bilbo 
                  and Gommum/ understood one another really (if you think of it)

                  and moving North and West, and many seemed now to be partly or 
                  wholly under the dominion of the Dark Lord. There were wars, 
                  and there was much burning and ruin. The dwarves were growing 
                  afraid. Goblins were multiplying again and reappearing. Trolls 
                  of a new and most malevolent kind were abroad; giants were

                  wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the

                  cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were

                  between the two races. In those ancient days Durin dwelt in 
                  Caron-dun, and there was traffic on the Great River. But the 
                  Goblins - fierce orcs (35) in great number - drove them out 
                  after many wars, and most of the dwarves that escaped removed 
                  far into the North. /.../ If there are orcs in the mines, it 
                  will prove ill for us. But most of the goblins of the Misty 
                  Mountains were destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies at the 
                  Lonely Mountain. There is a chance that the mines are still 
                  deserted.<BR>Note 35. This is not the first use of the word 
                  Orcs in the LR papers: Gandalf refers to 'orcs and goblins' 
                  among the servants of the Dark Lord, pp. 211 / Fr.114a/, 364 / 
                  Fr.114b/. /.../ But the rarity of the usage at this stage is 
                  remarkable. The word Orc goes back to the Lost Tales, and had 
                  been pervasive in all my father's subsequent writings. In the 
                  Lost Tales the two terms were used as equivalents, though some 
                  times apparently distinguished (see II. 364 /=Index/, entry 
                  Goblins). A clue may be found in a passage that occurs in both 
                  the earlier and the later Quenta (IV.82, V.233): 'Goblins they 
                  may be called, but in ancient days they mere strong and fell.' 
                  At this stage it seems that 'Orcs' are to be regarded as a 
                  more formidable kind of 'Goblin', so in the preliminary sketch 
                  for 'The Mines of Moria' (p. 443) Gandalf says 'there are 
                  goblins - of very evil kind, larger than usual, real orcs.' - 
                  It is incidentally notable that in the first edition of The 
                  Hobbit the word Orcs is used only once (at the end of Chapter 
                  VII 'Queer Lodgings'), while in the published LR goblins is 
                  hardly ever used. <BR>b. /Ibid. Note 38; earlier alternative 
                  version of Gandalf’s speech is referred to/ /Rend./ Gandalf's 
                  account of Moria here differs from the earlier form /.../ only 
                  in that here there is mention of Durin, of the peace between 
                  Elves and Dwarves, and of Orcs (see note 35) - the rejected 
                  version refers only to goblins. <BR><BR>Fr.121.<BR>RSh 
                  (HME6)/25. The Mines of Moria. /Rend./<BR>Gandalf says there 
                  are goblins - of very evil kind, larger than usual, real 
                  orcs.(2) Also certainly some kind of troll is leading them. 'I 
                  am going to try and find the opening words. I once knew every 
                  formula and spell in any language of elves, dwarves, or 
                  goblins that was ever used for such purposes. /.../ /About

                  passage in FR (p. 338), where Gandalf says: 'There are Orcs, 
                  very many of them. And some are large and evil: black Uruks of 
                  Mordor'. <BR><BR>/NB. На протяжении всеx томов HME 7-9 термины

                  by an Orc, and though that was revenged by Thorin and Dain, 
                  and many goblins were slain in war. /.../ /Comm./ This 
                  passage, of which only a trace remains in FR (pp. 253 - 4), 
                  reveals the development of new conceptions in the history of 
                  the Dwarves. In the original text of 'The Ring Goes South' 
                  (VI.429) Gandalf said that the Goblins drove the Dwarves from 
                  Moria, and most of those that escaped removed into the North. 
                  This must have been based on what was told in The Hobbit: in 
                  Chapter III Elrond had said that 'there are still forgotten 
                  treasures to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of 
                  Moria, since the dwarf and goblin war', and in Chapter IV 
                  there was a reference to the goblins having 'spread in secret 
                  after the sack of the mines of Moria'. Presumably therefore 
                  what my father said in the first version of 'The Ring Goes 
                  South' was what he actually had in mind when he wrote those 
                  passages in The Hobbit: the Goblins drove the Dwarves out of 
                  Moria. <BR>Note 3. In the original edition of The Hobbit the 
                  goblin who slew Thror in Moria was not named, as he is not in 
                  the present passage ('he was slain by an Orc'). In the third 
                  edition of 1966 the name Azog was introduced (from LR) in 
                  Chapter I as that of the slayer of Thror, and a footnote was 
                  added in Chapter XVII stating that Bolg, leader of the Goblins 
                  in the Battle of Five Armies, was the son of 
                  Azog.<BR>Fr.125.<BR>TI (HME 7)/9. The Mines of Moria (1). The 
                  Lord of Moria. <BR>When Gandalf was striving to find the spell 
                  that would open the doors he said that he once knew 'every 
                  spell in all the tongues of Elf, Dwarf, or Goblin' (FR 'of 
                  Elves or Men or Orcs') that was ever so used /.../ 'Goblins' 
                  appear again, as in the old version, where FR has 'Orcs', in 
                  Gandalf's 'There are older and fouler things than goblins in 
                  the deep places of the world.' /.../ The dwarves carried much 
                  away; and though the dread of its dark mazes has protected 
                  Moria from Men and Elves it has not defended it from the 
                  goblins, who have often invaded it and plundered it.' Against 
                  these my father wrote: 'Mithril is now nearly all lost. Orcs 
                  plunder it and pay tribute to Sauron who is collecting it 
                  /.../ 'No one knows,' said Gandalf. 'None have dared to seek 
                  for the armouries and treasure chambers down in the deep 
                  places since the dwarves fled. Unless it be plundering orcs.

                  and 'orcs' in VI.437 note 35 / Fr.120a/. In FR at this point 
                  Gandalf says: 'There are Orcs, very many of them. And some are

                  orc-chief, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to 
                  foot, leaped through the door. Behind him but not yet daring 
                  to advance stood many followers. His eyes were like coals of 
                  fire. He wielded a great spear. Boromir who was at the rear 
                  turned, but with a thrust of his shield the orc put aside his 
                  stroke and with huge strength bore him back and flung him 
                  down. Then leaping with the speed of a snake he charged and 
                  smote with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on 
                  the right side. Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned. 
                  Sam with a cry hewed at the spear and it broke.... but even as

                  of Elendil drove down upon his helm. There was a flash like 
                  flame and the helm burst. The orc-chieftain fell with cloven 
                  head.<BR>Away beyond the fiery fissure Frodo saw the swarming 
                  black figures of many orcs. They brandished spears and 
                  scimitars which shone red as blood. Boom, boom rolled the 
                  drum-beats now advancing louder and louder and more and more 
                  menacing. Two great dark troll-figures could be seen 
                  [?towering] among the orcs.<BR>/Comm./ /Version II/. (It may 
                  be noted incidentally that 'orcs', rather than 'goblins', 
                  becomes pervasive in this text: see note 5 / Fr.127/). /.../ 
                  Gandalf /.../ still says 'There are goblins... They are evil 
                  and large: black Orcs', but the troll becomes 'a great 
                  cave-troll' as in FR,<BR>b. LotR. 2:5 The Bridge of 
                  Khazad-dum.<BR>But even as they retreated, and before Pippin 
                  and Merry had reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, 
                  almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped 
                  into the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the 
                  doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like 
                  coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With 
                  a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword and 
                  bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under 
                  Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged 
                  into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. 
                  The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled 
                  against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the 
                  spear-shaft, and it broke. But even as the orc flung down the 
                  truncheon and swept out his scimitar, Andъril came down upon 
                  his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst 
                  asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled 
                  howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.<BR>`As I stood 
                  there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment 
                  I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was 
                  said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. 
                  All I caught was ghвsh; that is "fire". Then something came 
                  into the chamber – I felt it through the door, and the orcs 
                  themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the 
                  iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell.<BR>Arrows 
                  fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another 
                  pierced Gandalf's hat and stuck there like a black feather. 
                  Frodo looked behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black 
                  figures: there seemed to be hundreds of orcs. They brandished 
                  spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the 
                  firelight.<BR>Fr.129a-b.<BR>a. TI (HME 7)/13.

                  unbuckling his sword, and unslinging the small round shield at 
                  his back. The black iron cap was too large for Sam (for orcs 
                  have large heads for their size), but he slipped on the mail. 
                  It hung a little loose and long. He cast the black hooded 
                  cloak about him, took the whip and scimitar, and slung the red 
                  shield. Then they dragged the body behind the door and crept 
                  out. /.../ Frodo slipped on his Ring and drew aside; but Sam 
                  went on to meet the goblin. They brushed into one another and 
                  the goblin spoke in his harsh tongue; but Sam answered only 
                  with an angry snarl. That seemed satisfactory. /.../ The

                  (as renumbered). The synopsis of the former he altered thus: 
                  'Black orcs of Misty Mountains capture Merry and Pippin, bear 
                  them to Isengard. But the orcs are attacked by the

                  any minute to feel the sting of a blackfeathered orc-arrow. 
                  But it was now grown very dark, dark even for the keen 
                  night-eyes of goblins; goblins were on the bank, they did not 
                  doubt.<BR>/Comm. In later version/ 'it was very dark, dark 
                  even for the night-eyes of orcs'.<BR>b. LotR. 2:9. The Great 
                  River.<BR>‘Anduin is wide, yet the orcs can shoot their arrows 
                  far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have 
                  dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of 
                  Rohan.' /.../ They all leaned forward straining at the 
                  paddles: even Sam took a hand. Every moment they expected to 
                  feel the bite of black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead 
                  or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits. It 
                  was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Orcs, and in 
                  the star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes 
                  some mark, unless it was that the grey cloaks of Lorien and 
                  the grey timber of the elf-wrought boats defeated the malice 
                  of the archers of Mordor. /.../ `I can't abide fog,' said Sam; 
                  `but this seems to be a lucky one. Now perhaps we can get away 
                  without those cursed goblins seeing us.'<BR><BR>Fr.135.<BR>TI

                  Trotter sees by the shape and arms of the dead orcs that they 
                  are northern orcs of the Misty Mountains - from Moria? In fact 
                  they are orcs of Moria that escaped the elves, + others who 
                  are servants of Saruman.<BR>/Resulting draft/ 'These are not 
                  orcs of Mordor,' said Trotter. 'Some are from the Misty 
                  Mountains, if I know anything of orcs and their [gear &gt;] 
                  kinds; maybe they have come all the way from Moria. But what 
                  are these? Their gear is not all of goblin-make.' There were 
                  several orcs of large stature, armed with short swords, not 
                  the curved scimitars usual with goblins, and with great bows 
                  greater than their custom. Upon their shields they bore a 
                  device Trotter had not seen before: a small white hand in the 
                  centre of the black field. Upon the front of their caps was 
                  set a rune fashioned of some white metal (5). 'S is for 
                  Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.' 'Nay,' said 
                  Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Runes.' 'Neither does he use 
                  his right name or permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said 
                  Trotter. 'And he does not use white. The orcs of his immediate 
                  service bear the sign of the single eye.' He stood for a 
                  moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman. /.../ 'But orcs go

                  lightly behind. 'At least such an enemy is easy to follow. No 
                  other folk make such trampling. Why do they slash and beat 
                  down all the growing things as they pass? Does it please them 
                  to break plants and saplings that are not even in their way?' 
                  'It seems so,' answered [Trotter &gt;] Aragorn; 'but they go

                  great orcs were ordered to go to Isengard. They carry

                  and lord. Man's flesh to eat. /.../ <BR>/Comm./ The Orc-names 
                  are all present: Lugbtirz, Uruk-hai; Ugluk (leader of the 
                  Isengarders), Grishnak (so spelt), Lugdush. Ugluk does not use 
                  the word Halflings (TT p. 48), but calls them hobbits; he says 
                  'We are the servants of the old Uthwit and the White Hand' 
                  (cf. TT p. 49), this being Old English upwita 'sage, 
                  philosopher, one of great learning'; and he calls the descent 
                  into the plain of Rohan the Ladder (changed to the Stair: TT 
                  p. 50). Grishnak does not name the Nazgul (TT p. 49), but says 
                  'The winged one awaits us northward on the east bank'.

                  8)/1:4. Flotsam and Jetsam.<BR>I saw them go - endless lines 
                  of Orcs, and squadrons/troops of them mounted on great wolves 
                  (a Saruman notion?), and whole regiments of men, too. /.../ 
                  The following dialogue, concerning the 'goblin-men' 
                  reminiscent of the squint-eyed Southerner at Bree, and Merry's 
                  estimate of the forces that left Isengard that night, is much 
                  the same as in TT (p. 171), except that Aragorn says that they 
                  had had many of the goblin-men to deal with at the Hornburg 
                  'last night'.<BR>/Note that the word ‘South’ is equivalent of 
                  ‘Harad’, with possible accent on those regions of Harad which 
                  have been ever subdued by Gondor, UT 4:2, The Istari/.<BR>b. 
                  LotR 3:7. Helm's Deep.<BR>'Dawn is not far off,' said Gamling, 
                  who had now climbed up beside him. 'But dawn will not help us, 
                  I fear.' 'Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said Aragorn. 
                  'But these creatures of Isengard, these half-orcs and 
                  goblin-men that the foul craft of Saruman has bred, they will 
                  not quail at the sun,' said Gamling.<BR>/Cf. same two 
                  categories of orc-men half-breeds in Fr.170: There is no doubt 
                  that long afterwards, in the Third Age, Saruman rediscovered 
                  this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery 
                  committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs 
                  and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and 
                  Orc-men treacherous and vile/.<BR>c. LotR 3:9. Flotsam and 
                  Jetsam<BR>All Saruman's people were marching away. I don't 
                  know much about this war, or about the Horsemen of Rohan, but 
                  Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his 
                  men with one final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy 
                  go: endless lines of marching Orcs; and troops of them mounted 
                  on great wolves. And there were battalions of Men, too. Many 
                  of them carried torches, and in the flare I could see their 
                  faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and 
                  dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil-looking. But 
                  there were some others that were horrible: man-high, but with 
                  goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed. Do you know, they 
                  reminded me at once of that Southerner at Bree: only he was 
                  not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.'<BR>'I 
                  thought of him too,' said Aragorn. 'We had many of these 
                  half-orcs to deal with at Helm's Deep. It seems plain now that 
                  that Southerner was a spy of Saruman's.<BR>c-1. /Cf. on the 
                  said Southerner/: LotR. 1:10. Strider. In one of the windows 
                  he /Frodo/ caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly, 
                  slanting eyes; but it vanished at once. 'So that's where that 
                  southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'He looks more than half 
                  like a goblin.'<BR>d. LotR. 3:4. Treebeard. <BR>/Treebeard’s 
                  speech to hobbits/. ‘He /Saruman/ has taken up with foul folk, 
                  with the Orcs. Brm, hoom! Worse than that: he has been doing 
                  something to them; something dangerous. For these Isengarders 
                  are more like wicked Men. It is a mark of evil things that 
                  came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the Sun; but 
                  Saruman's Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder 
                  what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he 
                  blended the races of Orcs and Men? That would be a black 
                  evil!’<BR>Treebeard rumbled for a moment, as if he were 
                  pronouncing some deep, subterranean Entish malediction. 'Some 
                  time ago I began to wonder how Orcs dared to pass through my 
                  woods so freely,' he went on. 'Only lately did I guess that 
                  Saruman was to blame.<BR>e. SD (HME 9)/1:9. The Scouring of 
                  the Shire /from Orc-man Ruffian Sharrkey and his orc-men and 
                  barbarian men/<BR>/.../ Very orc-like all his /Ruff.Sharkey’s/ 
                  movements were, and he stooped now with his hands nearly 
                  touching the ground. /.../ The orc-man /Ruff.Sharkey/ looked 
                  at them with such a leer of hatred as they had not seen even 
                  in all their adventures. /.../ And then as with a groan and a 
                  curse the orc-man [?toppled] over him he stabbed upwards, and 
                  Sting passed clean through his body. <BR>/.../ It was some 
                  time before the last ruffians were hunted out. And oddly 
                  enough, little though the hobbits were inclined to believe it, 
                  quite a number turned out to be far from incurable. If they 
                  gave themselves up they were kindly treated, and fed (for they 
                  were usually half-starved after hiding in the woods), and then 
                  shown to the borders. This sort were Dunlanders, not 
                  orc-men/halfbreeds.<BR>Note 26. The footnote to the text in RK 
                  p. 298 'It /Name/ was probably Orkish in origin: Sharku

                  Minas Ithil, but it fell soon into his hands. It now prevented 
                  any coming in. It was manned by orcs and evil spirits. It had 
                  been called [Neleg Thilim &gt;] Neleglos [the Gleaming &gt;]

                  <BR>The brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and 
                  solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The years had 
                  gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, 
                  and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, 
                  rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning 
                  face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead. Upon 
                  its knees and mighty chair, and all about the pedestal, were 
                  idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot-folk 
                  of Mordor used.<BR>c. LotR. 5:10. The Black Gate Opens.<BR>The 
                  heralds cried aloud: ‘The Lords of Gondor have returned and 
                  all this land that is theirs they take back.’ The hideous 
                  orc-head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down and 
                  broken in pieces, and the old king’s head was raised and set 
                  in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden 
                  flowers: and men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul 
                  scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone.<BR><BR>Fr.148.<BR>WR

                  preliminary thoughts for its continuation. One of these, 
                  impossibly difficult to read, begins at the point where the 
                  draft C ends, with Faramir still speaking to Sam: 'But you 
                  have not the manners of orcs, nor their speech, and indeed 
                  Frodo your master has an air that I cannot ..., an elvish air 
                  maybe.' <BR><BR>Fr.149.<BR>WR (HME 8)/2:8. Kirith Ungol. -The

                  to hunt. The red eye had not been wholly blind. And a noise of 
                  feet and shouts came also through the cleft. Orcs were coming 
                  up to the pass out of Mordor too. /.../ Goblins go fast in 
                  tunnels, especially those which they have themselves made, and 
                  all the many passages in this region of the mountains were 
                  their work, even the main tunnel and the great deep pit where 
                  Shelob housed.<BR>Fr.150.<BR>WR (HME 8)/2:8. Kirith Ungol. 
                  -The Choise of Master Samwise.<BR>'Yes, and I know them, for I

                  bogey-men: sending messages to Lugburz.' <BR>Note 32. The 
                  reference is to The Hobbit, Chapter Ill 'A Short Rest', where 
                  Elrond, speaking of the swords Glamdring and Orcrist taken 
                  from the trolls' hoard, says (in the text of the original 
                  edition): 'They are old swords, very old swords of the elves 
                  that are now called Gnomes. They were made in Gondolin for the 
                  Goblin-wars.' <BR>Note 46. The names of the leaders of the 
                  Orc-bands were rather bewilderingly changed in the drafts (and 
                  some transient forms cannot be read). At first (p. 212) they 
                  were Gazmog (of the Tower) and Zaglun (of Minas Morghul), and 
                  in another brief draft of their genial greetings they become 
                  Yagul and Uftak Zaglun - so written: Zaglun may have been 
                  intended to replace Uftak, but on the other hand the 
                  double-barrelled Orc-name Naglur-Danlo is found (p. 212). The 
                  name Ufthak was subsequently given to the Orc found (and left 
                  where he was) by Shagrat and his friends in Shelob's larder, 
                  'wide awake and glaring' (TT p. 350). In the present text the 
                  names were at first Yagul (of the Tower) and Shagrat (of Minas 
                  Morghul), but were reversed in the course of writing (and in a 
                  following draft the names became reversed again at one point, 
                  though not I think intentionally). At this point, where the 
                  Orc from Morghul is speaking, my father first wrote Shag[rat), 
                  changed it to Yagul, and then again changed it to Shagrat. See 
                  note 48. - Yagul was replaced by Gorbag in the course of 
                  writing the fair copy. <BR>Note 47. Dushgoi: Orc name for 
                  Minas Morghul. <BR>Note 48. The text actually has Shagrat 
                  here, but this should have been changed to Yagsil (see note 
                  46). <BR>Fr.151.<BR>WR (HME 8)/3:3. Minas Tirith. <BR>'What is

                  daunted by shade or blade.' <BR><BR>Fr.154.<BR>SD (HME 9)/1:2. 
                  The Tower of Kirith Ungol. /Comm./<BR>The name of the sole 
                  surviving orc beside Shagrat is Radbug in both C and D (Snaga 
                  in RK; see LR Appendix F, p. 409), Radbug being retained in 
                  the final story as the name of an orc whose eyes Shagrat says 
                  that he had squeezed out (RK p. 182); in C the orcs whom Sam 
                  saw running from the gate and shot down as they fled are 
                  Lughorn and Ghash &gt; Mazgash (Lagduf and Muzgash in D, as in 
                  RK). /.../ When Gorbag rouses himself from among the corpses 
                  on the roof Sam sees in the latter, as in RK (p. 183), that he 
                  has in his hand 'a broad-headed spear with a short broken 
                  haft'; in C on the other hand he has 'a red [?and shining] 
                  sword. It was his own sword. /.../ With this cf. text B (p. 25 
                  and note 9): 'Frodo has to have orc-weapons. The sword is 
                  gone.'</FONT></P>

                  They were in black without tokens and were armed with bows, a 
                  small breed, black-skinned with wide snuffling nostrils, 
                  evidently trackers of some kind........ they were talking in 
                  some hideous unintelligible speech; but as they passed 
                  snuffling among the stones scarcely 20 yards from where the 
                  hobbits lurked Frodo saw that one was carrying on his arm a 
                  black mail-shirt very like the one that he had abandoned. He 
                  sniffed it as [he] went as if to recall its scent. All at once 
                  lifting his head he let out a cry. It was answered, and from 
                  the other direction (from Kirith Ungol now some miles behind) 
                  ... large fighting orcs came up with shields ....... 
                  [?painted] with the Eye. A [? babble] of talk in the common 
                  tongue now broke out.'Nar,' said the tracker, 'not a trace

                  Somebody that has no business here has been about. Different 
                  smell, but a bad smell: we've lost that too, it went up into 
                  the mountains.' 'A lot of use you little snufflers are,' 
                  grunted a bigger orc. 'I reckon eyes are better than your

                  mentioned. The orc 'slave-drivers' are called 'two of the

                  the first time that the word was used (though the name 
                  Uruk-hai had appeared long since, VII.409, VIII.22, see also

                  fled back east into Middle-earth. There many of their race

                  Version II /AAm*/.<BR>[§17]<BR>This paragraph underwent 
                  several modifications /in comp. with AAm/: Now Melkor knew all 
                  that was done; for even then he had secret friends among the 
                  Maiar, whom he had converted to his cause, whether in the

                  the chief, as afterwards became known, was Sauron, a great 
                  craftsman of the household of Aule. Thus far off in the dark 
                  places of Ea, to which he had retreated, Melkor was filled

                  he desired to make subject to himself. Therefore he had 
                  gathered to himself spirits out of the voids of Ea who served 
                  him, until he deemed that he was strong; and seeing now his 
                  time he drew near to Arda again; and he looked down upon it, 
                  and the beauty of the Earth in its Spring filled him with 
                  wonder, but because it was not his, he resolved to destroy it.

                  /AAm/.<BR>[§30]<BR>For one thousand years of the Trees the 
                  Valar dwelt in bliss in Valinor beyond the Mountains of Aman, 
                  and all Middle-earth lay in a twilight under the stars. 
                  Thither the Valar seldom came, save only Yavanna and Orome; 
                  and Yavanna often would walk there in the shadows, grieving 
                  because all the growth and promise of the Spring of Arda was 
                  checked. And she set a sleep upon many fair things that had 
                  arisen in the Spring, both tree and herb and beast and bird, 
                  so that they should not age but should wait for a time of 
                  awakening that yet should he. But Melkor dwelt in Utumno, and 
                  he slept not, but watched, and laboured; and the evil things 
                  that he had perverted walked abroad, and the dark and 
                  slumbering woods were haunted by monsters and shapes of dread. 
                  And in Utumno he wrought the race of demons whom the Elves 
                  after named the Balrogs. But these came not yet from the gates 
                  of Utumno, because of the watchfulness of Orome. <BR>/Comm. to 
                  §30/. In AAm there is now recounted the laying by Yavanna of a 
                  sleep on living things that had awoken in the Spring of Arda, 
                  of which there is no trace in QS (or in the later rewritings). 
                  The making of the Balrogs is then mentioned; and while in AAm 
                  (§17) the account of Melkor's 'host', spirits 'out of the 
                  voids of Ea' and 'secret friends and spies among the Maiar', 
                  is fuller than in the other tradition at any stage, the 
                  Balrogs are still firmly stated to be demons of his own 
                  making, and moreover to have been made in Utumno at this time.

                  Version II /AAm*/.<BR>[§30] But Melkor dwelt in Utumno, and he 
                  did not sleep, but watched and laboured; and whatsoever good 
                  Yavanna worked in the lands he undid if he could, and the evil 
                  things that he had perverted walked far abroad, and the dark 
                  and slumbering woods were haunted by monsters and shapes of 
                  dread. And in Utumno he multiplied the race of the evil 
                  spirits that followed him, the Umaiar, of whom the chief were 
                  those demons whom the Elves afterwards named the Balrogath. 
                  But they did not yet come forth from the gates of Utumno 
                  because of their fear of Orome. <BR>The latter part of this 
                  passage is of much interest as showing a marked development 
                  from the idea that Melkor 'made' the Balrogs at this time (see 
                  p. 78 / Fr.160 suppl.c, Comm./). They now become 'evil spirits 
                  (Umaiar) that followed him' - but he could 'multiply' them. 
                  The term Umaiar, not met before, stands to Maiar as Uvanimor 
                  to Vanimor (see /HME/ IV.293, footnote).<BR>[§31] ... and 
                  there would go a-hunting under the stars. He had great love of 
                  horses and of hounds, but all beasts were in his thought, and 
                  he hunted only the monsters and fell creatures of Melkor. If 
                  he descried them afar or his great hounds got wind of them, 
                  then his white horse, Nahar, shone like silver as it ran 
                  through the shadows, and the sleeping earth trembled at the 
                  beat of his golden hooves. And at the mort Orome would blow 
                  his great horn, until the mountains shook... mort: the 
                  horn-call blown at the kill. ... and trusting ever to his 
                  slaves to do his evil work. [his slaves and creatures, 
                  AAm].</FONT></P>

                  (HME 10)/2. The Annals of Aman /AAm /<BR>Year 1085<BR>[§41] 
                  And when the Elves had dwelt in the world five and thirty 
                  Years of the Valar (which is like unto three hundred and 
                  thirty-five of our years) it chanced that Orome rode to Endon 
                  in his hunting, and he turned north by the shores of Helkar 
                  and passed under the shadows of the Orokarni, the Mountains of 
                  the East. And on a sudden Nahar set up a great neighing and 
                  then stood still. And Orome wondered and sat silent, and it 
                  seemed to him that in the quiet of the land under the stars he 
                  heard afar off many voices singing.<BR>[§42]<BR>Thus it was 
                  that the Valar found at last, as it were by chance, those whom 
                  they had so long awaited /i.e., the Elves/. And when Orome 
                  looked upon them he was filled with wonder, as though they 
                  were things unforeseen and unimagined; and he loved the 
                  Quendi, and named them Eldar, the people of the stars. <BR>The 
                  original manuscript page was interpolated at this point, a 
                  passage being written in the-margin as follows: <BR>Yet by 
                  after-knowledge the masters of lore say sadly that Orome was 
                  not, mayhap, the first of the Great Ones to look upon the 
                  Elves. for Melkor was on the watch, and his spies were many. 
                  And it is thought that lurking near his servants had led 
                  astray some of the Quendi that ventured afield, and they took 
                  them as captives to Utumno, and there enslaved them. Of these 
                  slaves it is held came the Orkor that were afterward chief 
                  foes of the Eldar. And Melkor's lies were soon abroad, so that 
                  whispers were heard among the Quendi, warning them that if any 
                  of their kindred passed away into the shadows and were seen no 
                  more, they must beware of a fell huntsman on a great horse, 
                  for he it was that carried them off to devour them. Hence it 
                  was that at the approach of Orome many of the Quendi fled and 
                  hid themselves. <BR>The original text then continues, with a 
                  new date 1086, 'Swiftly Orome rode back to Valinor and brought 
                  tidings to the Valar' (see §46 below). But the interpolated 
                  passage just given was subsequently replaced on a new page by 
                  the following long and important passage §§43 - 5 (found in 
                  the typescript as typed): <BR>[§43] Yet many of the Quendi 
                  were adread at his coming. This was the doing of Melkor. For 
                  by after-knowledge the masters of lore say that Melkor, ever 
                  watchful, was first aware of the awakening of the Quendi, and 
                  sent shadows and evil spirits to watch and waylay them. So it 
                  came to pass, some years ere the coming of Orome, that if any 
                  of the Elves strayed far abroad, alone or few together, they 
                  would often vanish and never return; and the Quendi said that 
                  the Hunter had caught them, and they were afraid. Even so, in 
                  the most ancient songs of our people, of which some echoes are 
                  remembered still in the West, we hear of the shadow-shapes 
                  that walked in the hills about Kuivienen, or would pass 
                  suddenly over the stars; and of the dark Rider upon his wild 
                  horse that pursued those that wandered to take them and devour 
                  them. Now Melkor greatly hated and feared the riding of Orome, 
                  and either verily he sent his dark servants as riders, or he 
                  set lying whispers abroad, for the purpose that the Quendi 
                  should shun Orome, if ever haply they met. <BR>[§44] Thus it 
                  was that when Nahar neighed and Orome indeed came among them, 
                  some of the Quendi hid themselves, and some fled and were 
                  lost. But those that had the courage to stay perceived swiftly 
                  that the Great Rider was noble and fair and no shape out of 
                  Darkness; for the Light of Aman was in his face, and all the 
                  noblest of the Quendi were drawn towards it. <BR>[§45] But of 
                  those hapless who were ensnared by Melkor little is known of a 
                  certainty. For who of the living hath descended into the pits 
                  of Utumno, or hath explored the darkness of the counsels of 
                  Melkor? Yet this is held true by the wise of Eressea: that all 
                  those of the Quendi that came into the hands of Melkor, ere 
                  Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts 
                  of cruelty and wickedness were corrupted and enslaved. Thus 
                  did Melkor breed the hideous race of the Orkor in envy and 
                  mockery of the Eldar, of whom they were afterwards the 
                  bitterest foes. For the Orkor had life and multiplied after 
                  the manner of the Children of Iluvatar; and naught that had 
                  life of its own, nor the semblance thereof, could ever Melkor 
                  make since his rebellion in the Ainulindale before the 
                  Beginning: so say the wise. And deep in their dark hearts the 
                  Orkor loathed the Master whom they served in fear, the maker 
                  only of their misery. This maybe was the vilest deed of Melkor 
                  and the most hateful to Eru.<BR>/Comm./ (§42 - 5 The origin of 
                  the Orcs. The first appearance of the idea that their origin 
                  was connected with the Elves is in QS §18 / Fr.102/, and later 
                  in QS (§62) / Fr.103a/ it is said that when Morgoth returned 
                  to Middle-earth after the destruction of the Trees he brought 
                  into being the race of the Orcs, and they grew and multiplied 
                  in the bowels of the earth. These Orcs Morgoth made in envy 
                  and mockery of the Elves, and they were made of stone, but 
                  their hearts of hatred. (For my father's changing views 
                  concerning the time of the origin of the Orcs in the 
                  chronology of the Elder Days see /HME/ IV.314, /HME/ V.238. 
                  /Frr.92, 103a/) In the interpolation into the manuscript of 
                  AAm and its subsequent rewriting and extension (pp. 72 - 4 
                  /see this Fr., above, §42/) there appears, together with the 
                  story of the Rider who was rumoured to carry off the Quendi if 
                  they strayed, the theory that Melkor bred the Orcs (here 
                  called Orkor) 'in envy and mockery of the Eldar' from Quendi 
                  enslaved in the east of Middle-earth before ever Orome came 
                  upon them. It is explicit (§45) that Melkor could make nothing 
                  that had life of its own since his rebellion; but this is in 
                  sharp contradiction to §30 / Fr.160 suppl.c/, where it is said 
                  that 'in Utumno he wrought the race of demons whom the Elves 
                  after named the Balrogs'. I do not think that the 
                  interpolation in which the former of these statements appears 
                  was made after any very long interval: my father's views on 
                  this subject seem to have been changing swiftly, and a 
                  different account of the origin of the Balrogs is found in the 
                  soon abandoned type- script which I have called AAm* (see p. 
                  79, §30 / Fr.160 suppl.d/). The retention of the statement in 
                  §30, despite its contradiction to that in §45, was no doubt 
                  due to oversight, and both appear in the main typescript of 
                  AAm. - See further on the question of the origin of the Orcs 
                  p. 123, §127 / Fr.162 b/, and pp. 408 ff. / Fr.168/<BR>§ 43 
                  Against the middle portion of this paragraph is a note in the 
                  margin: 'Alter this. Orcs are not Elvish.' See pp. 408 ff. / 
                  Fr.168/.<BR><BR>Fr.162a-c.<BR>MR (HME 10)/2. The Annals of 
                  Aman /AAm/<BR>a. [§ 127]<BR>/After the Trees’ destruction and 
                  the fight with Ungoloint/. Then Morgoth being freed gathered 
                  again all his servants that he could find, and he delved anew 
                  his vast vaults and his dungeons in that place which the 
                  Noldor after called Angband, and above them he reared the 
                  reeking towers of Thangorodrim. There countless became the 
                  hosts of his beasts and his demons; and thence there now came 
                  forth in hosts beyond count the fell race of the Orkor, that 
                  had grown and multiplied in the bowels of the earth like a 
                  plague. These creatures Morgoth bred in envy and mockery of 
                  the Eldar. In form (5) they were like unto the Children of 
                  Iluvatar, yet foul to look upon; for they were bred (6) in 
                  hatred, and with hatred they were filled; and he loathed the 
                  things that he had wrought, and with loathing they served him. 
                  Their voices were as the clashing of stones, and they laughed 
                  not save only at torment and cruel deeds. The Glamhoth, host 
                  of tumult, the Noldor called them. (Orcs we may name them; for 
                  in days of old they were strong and fell as demons. Yet they 
                  were not of demon kind, but children (7) of earth corrupted by 
                  Morgoth, and they could be slain or destroyed by the valiant 
                  with weapons of war. [But indeed a darker tale some yet tell 
                  in Eressea, saying that the Orcs were verily in their 
                  beginning of the Quendi themselves, a kindred of the Avari 
                  unhappy whom Morgoth cozened, and then made captive, and so 
                  enslaved them, and so brought them utterly to ruin. *For, 
                  saith Pengolod, Melkor could never since the Ainulindale' make 
                  of his own aught that had life or the semblance of life, and 
                  still less might he do so after his treachery in Valinor and 
                  the fullness of his own corruption.](8) Quoth AElfwine.)

                  said that this he did in the Dark ere ever the Quendi were 
                  found by Orome.<BR>Note 5. This passage was emended from the 
                  original text, which read thus: ‘There countless became the

                  7. 'children' is an emendation of 'a spawn'. <BR>Note 8. This 
                  passage, from 'But indeed a darker tale...' and including the 
                  footnote, was struck out at a later time than the changes 
                  given in notes 5 - 7 and perhaps in revision of the text 
                  before the making of the typescript, in which it does not 
                  appear. The whole addition by AElfwine is enclosed within 
                  brackets as originally written. <BR>b. /Comm./ to §127 The 
                  origin of the Orcs. In QS (§62 / Fr.103a/) the idea had 
                  already arisen that the Orcs originated in mockery of the 
                  Elves, but not yet that the Orcs were in any other way 
                  associated with them: they were a 'creation' of Morgoth's own, 
                  'made of stone', and he brought them into being when he 
                  returned to Middle-earth. As AAm was first written (see notes 
                  5 - 7 above / Fr.162a, Notes 5-7/) this view still held; the 
                  word 'made' was still used - though not the words 'made of 
                  stone'. But in AElfwine's note that follows (and which was 
                  written continuously with what precedes) they are called 'a 
                  spawn of earth corrupted by Morgoth'; and the 'darker tale' 
                  told in Eressea - that the Orcs were in their beginning 
                  enslaved and corrupted Elves (Avari) - is certainly the first 
                  appearance of this idea, contradicting what precedes, or 
                  perhaps rather at this stage presenting an alternative theory. 
                  It is ascribed to Pengolod; and Pengolod argues to AElfwine 
                  that Melkor could actually make nothing that had life, but 
                  could only corrupt what was already living. The implication of 
                  this second theory would probably, though not necessarily, be 
                  that the Orcs came into being much earlier, before the 
                  Captivity of Melkor; and that this implication is present is 
                  suggested by the footnote reference to the Annals of Beleriand 
                  - meaning the last version of these Annals, the Grey Annals, 
                  companion to the Annals of Aman: 'it is said that this he did 
                  in the Dark ere ever the Quendi were found by Orome.' <BR>At 
                  this point my father went back to an earlier part of AAm (p. 
                  72, §42 / Fr.161/) and interpolated the passage 'Yet by after- 
                  knowledge ...', where the idea of the capture of wandering 
                  Quendi in their earliest days is filled out, though it remains 
                  only a supposition of the 'masters of lore'. Perhaps at the 
                  same time he emended the present passage, changing 'he brought 
                  now into being' to 'thence there now came forth in hosts 
                  beyond count', 'made' to 'bred', and 'a spawn of earth' to 
                  'children of earth'. He then (as I conjecture) developed the 
                  interpolation at the earlier point much more fully (§§43 - 5 / 
                  Fr.161/), where the idea becomes less a supposition than a 
                  certainty of history: the powerlessness of Melkor to make 
                  living things is a known fact ('so say the wise'). Finally, at 
                  a later time (see note 8), he cut out the whole passage at the 
                  end of §127 beginning 'But indeed a darker tale some yet tell 
                  in Eressea ...' - either because he only then observed that it 
                  had been superseded by §§43 - 5 and was in any case not in the 
                  appropriate place, or because he rejected this theory of the 
                  origin of the Orcs. See further p. 127, §127 / Fr.162

                  <P><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size=2>The word for 
                  in 'Orcs we may name them; for in days of old they were strong 
                  and fell as demons. Yet they were not of demon kind' (an 
                  observation of AElfwine's) suggests that Orcs is Old English 
                  (cf. orc-neas in Beowulf line 112), conveniently similar to 
                  the Elvish word. This would explain why AElfwine said, in 
                  effect, 'We may call them Orcs, because they were strong and 
                  fell as demons, even though they were not in fact demons.' In 
                  a letter of my father's written on 25 April 1954 (Letters 
                  no.144) he said that the word Orc 'is as far as I am concerned 
                  actually derived from Old English orc "demon", but only 
                  because of its phonetic suitability' (and also: 'Orcs... are 
                  nowhere clearly stated to be of any particular origin. But 
                  since they are servants of the Dark Power, and later of 
                  Sauron, neither of whom could, or would, produce living 
                  things, they must be "corruptions"').<BR>c. /Later Comm./ 
                  Among the notes and corrections written by my father on the 
                  typescript in this section of AAm, not all of which need be 
                  recorded, there are several indicating proposed extensions of 
                  the narrative. <BR>/.../ §127 Against the opening of this 
                  paragraph my father wrote: 'The making of this fortress as a 
                  guard against a landing from the West should come earlier. See 
                  p. 156, §12. In the typescript the passage concerning the Orcs 
                  ran as it stands in the text printed from the manuscript on p. 
                  109 only as far as 'they could be slain or destroyed by the 
                  valiant with weapons of war'; the remainder of the paragraph 
                  had been struck out in the manuscript (note 8, p. 121 / 
                  Fr.162a. Note 8/), apart from the words 'Quoth AElfwine' at 
                  the end (which the typist did not notice and omitted, ending 
                  the paragraph at 'weapons of war' without closing the 
                  brackets). Against the first part of the passage my father 
                  wrote an X on the typescript and a brief illegible direction 
                  of which the first word might be 'cut', with a reference to 
                  the passage on the subject in §45. It is not clear what 
                  precisely was to be cut (if I read the word correctly), but 
                  seeing that he noted on the typescript against the earlier 
                  passage (p. 80, §43 / Fr.161/): 'Alter this. Orcs are not 
                  Elvish', it seems likely that the same objection applied here 
                  (see further pp. 408 ff. / Fr.168/). - He rectified the 
                  typist's error in omitting the words 'Quoth AElfwine' by 
                  cutting out the words '(Orcs we may name them; for', so that 
                  the text reads: 'The Glamhoth, host of tumult, the Noldor 
                  called them. In days of old they were strong and fell as 
                  demons ...' This was perhaps done without consulting the 
                  manuscript. <BR><BR>Fr.163.<BR>MR (HME 10)/3:1:3. The Later 
                  Quenta Silmarillion. /LQ 1+ LQ 2 /. The First Phase. Of the 
                  Coming of the Elves. <BR>[§18] <BR>In all this time, since 
                  Melkor overthrew the Lamps, the Middle-earth east of the 
                  Mountains was without light. While the Lamps had shone, growth 
                  began there which now was checked, because all was again dark. 
                  But already the oldest living things had arisen: in the sea 
                  the great weeds, and on the earth the shadow of great trees; 
                  and in the valleys of the night-clad hills there were dark 
                  creatures old and strong. In those lands and forests Orome 
                  would often hunt; and there too at times Yavanna came, singing 
                  sorrowfully; for she was grieved at the darkness of 
                  Middle-earth and ill content that it was forsaken. But the 
                  other Valar came seldom thither; and in the North Melkor built 
                  his strength, and gathered his demons about him. These were 
                  the first made of his creatures: their hearts were of fire, 
                  but they were cloaked in darkness, and terror went before 
                  them; they had whips of flame. Balrogs they were named by the 
                  Noldor in later days. And in that dark time Melkor made many 
                  other monsters of divers shapes and kinds that long troubled 
                  the world; yet the Orcs were not made until he had looked upon 
                  the Elves, and he made them in mockery of the Children of 
                  Iluvatar. His realm spread now ever southward over the 
                  Middle-earth. <BR>/Comm./ § 18 In AAm § 30 (p. 70 / Fr.160 
                  suppl.c/) it is said that Melkor 'wrought' the Balrogs in 
                  Utumno during the long darkness after the fall of the Lamps; 
                  but in an interpolation to AAm there enters the view that 
                  Melkor, after his rebellion, could make nothing that had life 
                  of its own (§45, see pp. 74, 78 / Fr.161/), and in AAm*, the 
                  second version of the opening of AAm (p. 79, §30 / Fr.160 
                  suppl.d/), the Balrogs become the chief of 'the evil spirits 
                  that followed him, the Umaiar', whom at that time he 
                  multiplied. The statement in QS §18 / Fr.102/ that the Balrogs 
                  were 'the first made of his creatures' survived through all 
                  the texts of the later revision of the Quenta, but in the 
                  margin of one of the copies of LQ 2 my father wrote: 'See 
                  Valaquenta for true account.' This is a reference to the 
                  passage which appears in the published Silmarillion on p. 
                  31:<BR>For of the Maiar many were drawn to his splendour in 
                  the days of his greatness, and remained in that allegiance 
                  down into his darkness; and others he corrupted afterwards to 
                  his service with lies and treacherous gifts. Dreadful among 
                  these spirits were the Valaraukar, the scourges of fire that 
                  in Middle-earth were called the Balrogs, demons of terror. The 
                  actual text of LQ 2 my father emended at this time very 
                  hastily to read: These were the (ealar) spirits who first 
                  adhered to him in the days of his splendour, and became most 
                  like him in his corruption: their hearts were of fire, but 
                  they were cloaked in darkness, and terror went before them; 
                  they had whips of flame. Balrogs they were named by the Noldor 
                  in later days. And in that dark time Melkor bred many other 
                  monsters of divers shapes and kinds that long troubled the 
                  world; and his realm spread now ever southward over the 
                  Middle-earth. But the Orks, mockeries and perversions of the 
                  Children of Eru, did not appear until after the Awakening of 
                  the Elves.<BR>There is a footnote to the word ealar in this 
                  passage: 'spirit' (not incarnate, which was fea, S[indarin] 
                  fae). eala 'being'. On the origin of the Orcs in AAm (and 
                  especially with respect to the word 'perversions' in the 
                  passage just given) see pp. 78 / Fr.161/, 123 - 4 / Fr.162b/. 
                  Orks was my father's late spelling.<BR><BR>Fr.164.<BR>MR (HME

                  First Phase. Of the Flight of Noldoli. /Comm./ <BR>The textual 
                  history of this chapter is relatively simple (for the late 
                  rewriting just referred to, which extends some little way into 
                  it, see pp. 292 ff.). The original chapter in QS (V.232 - 8 
                  /see Fr.103a/, where it is numbered 5) was corrected, not very 
                  extensively, at the time of the 1951 revision, and as 
                  corrected was typed in the amanuensis text LQ 1. This received 
                  no corrections at all, but on the later amanuensis typescript 
                  LQ 2 my father made a few changes, mostly the regular 
                  alteration of names. In this case I do not give the revised 
                  text, but record individually the significant changes made to 
                  QS. /.../ <BR>§62 /see Fr.103a/. The passage concerning the 
                  Orcs, from 'he brought into being the race of the Orcs' to the 
                  end of the paragraph, was rewritten as follows:<BR>he brought 
                  into being the race of the Orkor,* and they grew and 
                  multiplied in the bowels of the earth. These creatures Morgoth 
                  made in envy and mockery of the Elves. Therefore in form they 
                  were like unto the Children of Iluvatar, yet foul to look 
                  upon; for they were made in hatred, and with hatred they were 
                  filled. Their voices were as the clashing of stones, and they 
                  laughed not, save only at torment and cruel deeds. Clamhoth, 
                  the hosts of tumult, the Noldor called them.<BR>*[footnote to 
                  the text) In Cnomish speech this name is orch of one, yrch of 
                  many. Orcs we may name them, for in the ancient days they were 
                  strong and fell as demons; yet they were of other kind, a 
                  spawn of earth corrupted by the power of Morgoth, and they 
                  could be slain or destroyed by the valiant: quoth 
                  AElfwine.<BR>This is closely related to AAm §127, as that was 
                  first written (see pp.120-1, notes 5-7 / Fr.162a, Notes 5-7/, 
                  and commentary p. 123 / Fr.162b/), and contains the same 
                  conjunction of two apparently different theories, that the 
                  Orcs were 'made' by Morgoth and that they were 'a spawn of 
                  earth' corrupted by him. My father then altered the passage by 
                  cutting out AElfwine's footnote to the word Orkor but adding a 
                  closely similar passage in the body of the text, 
                  thus:<BR>Glamhoth, the hosts of tumult, the Noldor called 
                  them. Orcs we may name them,* for in ancient days they were 
                  strong and fell as demons. Yet they were not of demon-kind, 
                  but a spawn of earth corrupted by Morgoth, and they could be 
                  slain or destroyed by the valiant with weapons of war. 
                  <BR>*[footnote to the text] Quoth AElfwine.<BR>This 
                  rearrangement is puzzling, for AElfwine's contribution can 
                  hardly be limited to the words 'Orcs we may name them' (see p. 
                  124 / Fr.162b/); but perhaps by placing the asterisk at this 
                  point my father meant to indicate that all that follows it was 
                  added by AElfwine. On the LQ typescript he changed it again, 
                  putting the whole passage from 'Orcs we may name them' into a 
                  footnote.<BR>On the QS manuscript he scribbled later, against 
                  the first part of the passage, concerning the making of the 
                  Orcs: 'Alter this. See Annals.' This refers to the change 
                  introduced into AAm whereby the Orcs had been bred from 
                  captured Quendi many ages before: see the commentary on AAm

                  (HME 10)/5:6. Myths Transformed. Melkor Morgoth. /Autocomm./ 
                  <BR>VI<BR>This text, entitled Melkor with Morgoth written 
                  beneath, is from the same collection as is text III (found in 
                  a newspaper dated April 1959), and was written on four slips 
                  made from further copies of the same Merton College documents 
                  dated June 1955 as is the draft A of the Athrabeth (pp. 
                  350-2). The slip on which text III is written carries also 
                  preliminary drafting for the present essay on Melkor.<BR>It is 
                  notable that text VI begins with a reference to 'Finrod and 
                  Andreth', which was therefore in existence, at least in some 
                  form.<BR>Melkor Morgoth<BR>Melkor must be made far more 
                  powerful in original nature (cf. 'Finrod and Andreth'). The 
                  greatest power under Eru (sc. the greatest created power) (1). 
                  (He was to make/ devise / begin; Manwл (a little less great) 
                  was to improve, carry out, complete.)<BR>Later, he must not be 
                  able to be controlled or 'chained' by all the Valar combined. 
                  Note that in the early age of Arda he was alone able to drive 
                  the Valar out of Middle-earth into retreat.<BR>The war against 
                  Utumno was only undertaken by the Valar with reluctance, and 
                  without hope of real victory, but rather as a covering action 
                  or diversion, to enable them to get the Quendi out of his 
                  sphere of influence. But Melkor had already pro-gressed some 
                  way towards becoming 'the Morgoth, a tyrant (or central 
                  tyranny and will), + his agents'. (2) Only the total contained 
                  the old power of the complete Melkor; so that if 'the Morgoth' 
                  could be reached or temporarily separated from his agents he 
                  was much more nearly controllable and on a power-level with 
                  the Valar. The Valar find that they can deal with his agents 
                  (sc. armies, Balrogs, etc.) piecemeal. So that they come at 
                  last to Utumno itself and find that 'the Morgoth' has no 
                  longer for the moment sufficient 'force' (in any sense) to 
                  shield himself from direct personal contact. Manwe at last 
                  faces Melkor again, as he has not done since he entered Arda. 
                  Both are amazed: Manwe to perceive the decrease in Melkor as a 
                  person, Melkor to perceive this also from his own point of 
                  view: he has now less personal force than Manwл, and can no 
                  longer daunt him with his gaze.<BR>Either Manwe must tell him 
                  so or he must himself suddenly realize (or both) that this has 
                  happened: he is 'dispersed'. But the lust to have creatures 
                  under him, dominated, has become habitual and necessary to 
                  Melkor, so that even if the process was reversible (possibly 
                  was by absolute and unfeigned self-abasement and repentance 
                  only) he cannot bring himself to do it.* As with all other 
                  characters there must be a trembling moment when it is in the 
                  balance: he nearly repents - and does not, and becomes much 
                  wickeder, and more foolish.<BR>Possibly (and he thinks it 
                  possible) he could now at that moment be humiliated against 
                  his own will and 'chained' — if and before his dispersed 
                  forces reassemble. So - as soon as he has mentally rejected 
                  repentance - he (just like Sauron after-wards on this model) 
                  makes a mockery of self-abasement and repentance. From which 
                  actually he gets a kind of perverted pleasure as in 
                  desecrating something holy - [for the mere contemplating of 
                  the possibility of genuine repentance, if that did not come 
                  specially then as a direct grace from Eru, was at least one 
                  last flicker of his true primeval nature.] (3). He feigns 
                  remorse and repentance. He actually kneels before Manwe and 
                  surrenders — in the first instance to avoid being chained by 
                  the Chain Angainor, which once upon him he fears would not 
                  ever be able to be shaken off. But also suddenly he has the 
                  idea of penetrating the vaunted fastness of Valinor, and 
                  ruining it. So he offers to become 'the least of the Valar' 
                  and servant of them each and all, to help (in advice and 
                  skill) in repairing all the evils and hurts he has done. It is 
                  this offer which seduces or deludes Manwe - Manwe must be 
                  shown to have his own inherent fault (though not sin):** he 
                  has become engrossed (partly out of sheer fear of Melkor, 
                  partly out of desire to control him) in amendment, healing, 
                  re-ordering — even 'keeping the status quo' — to the loss of 
                  all creative power and even to weakness in dealing with 
                  difficult and perilous situations. Against the advice of some 
                  of the Valar (such as Tulkas) he grants Melkor's 
                  prayer.<BR>Melkor is taken back to Valinor going last (save 
                  for Tulkas*** who follows bearing Angainor and clinking it to 
                  remind Melkor).<BR>But at the council Melkor is not given 
                  immediate freedom. The Valar in assembly will not tolerate 
                  this. Melkor is remitted to Mandos (to stay there in 
                  'reclusion' and meditate, and complete his repentance — and 
                  also his plans for redress).(4)<BR>Then he begins to doubt the 
                  wisdom of his own policy, and would have rejected it all and 
                  burst out into flaming rebellion – but he is now absolutely 
                  isolated from his agents and in enemy territory. He cannot. 
                  Therefore he swallows the bitter pill (but it greatly 
                  increases his hate, and he ever afterward accused Manwл of 
                  being faithless).<BR>The rest of the story, with Melkor's 
                  release, and permission to attend the Council sitting at the 
                  feet of Manwл (after the pattern of evil counsellors in later 
                  tales, which it could be said derive from this primeval 
                  model?), can then proceed more or less as already told.<BR>In 
                  this short essay it is seen that in his reflections on the 
                  nature of Melkor, the vastness of his primeval power and its 
                  'dispersion', my father had been led to propose certain 
                  important alterations in the narrative of the legends as told 
                  in the Quenta Silmarillion (pp. 161, 186) and in the Annals of 
                  Aman (pp. 75, 80, 93). In the narrative as it stood, and as it 
                  remained, (5) there was no suggestion that Melkor feigned 
                  repentance when (no longer able to 'daunt him with his gaze') 
                  he faced Manwл in Utumno - already harbouring 'the idea of 
                  penetrating the vaunted fastness of Valinor, and ruining it'. 
                  On the contrary, 'Tulkas stood forth as the champion of the 
                  Valar and wrestled with him and cast him upon his face, and 
                  bound him with the chain Angainor' (6) (an ancient element, 
                  going back to the richly pictorial and 'primitive' account in 
                  the story of 'The Chaining of Melko' in The Book of Lost 
                  Tales, I.100-4). Moreover, in the present text it was now, 
                  defeated at Utumno, that Melkor offered to become 'the least 
                  of the Valar', and to aid them in the redress of all the evils 
                  that he had brought to pass, whereas in the narratives he did 
                  this when he came before the Valar after he had endured the 
                  ages of his incarcera-tion in Mandos and sued for pardon. Of 
                  Manwл it was said, when Melkor was allowed to go freely about 
                  Valinor, that he believed that his evil was cured: 'for he 
                  himself was free from the evil and could not comprehend it'. 
                  No such flaw or 'inherent fault' in Manwл as is described in 
                  this essay was suggested; (7) although it was told that Ulmo, 
                  and Tulkas, doubted the wisdom of such clemency (and this too 
                  is an element that goes back to The Book of Lost Tales: 'Such 
                  was the doom of Manwл ... albeit Tulkas and Palъrien thought 
                  it merciful to peril' (I.105)).<BR>*[footnote to the text] One 
                  of the reasons for his self-weakening is that he has given to 
                  his 'creatures', Orcs, Balrogs, etc. power of recuperation and 
                  multiplication. So that they will gather again without further 
                  specific orders. Part of his native creative power has gone 
                  out into making an independent evil growth out of his 
                  control.<BR>** [footnote to the text] Every finite creature 
                  must have some weakness: that is some inadequacy to deal with 
                  some situations. It is not sinful when not willed, and when 
                  the creature does his best (even if it is not what should be 
                  done) as he sees it - with the conscious intent of serving 
                  Eru.<BR>***[footnote to the text] Tulkas represents the good 
                  side of 'violence' in the war against evil. This is an absence 
                  of all compromise which will even face apparent evils (such as 
                  war) rather than parley; and does not (in any kind of pride) 
                  think that any one less than Eru can redress this, or rewrite 
                  the tale of Arda.<BR>Note 1. Cf. Finrod's words in the 
                  Athrabeth (p. 322): 'there is no power conceivable greater 
                  than Melkor save Eru only'.<BR>Note 2. The earliest reference 
                  to the idea of the 'dispersion' of Melkor's original power is 
                  found in the Annals of Aman §179 (p. 133): For as he grew in 
                  malice, and sent forth from himself the evil that he conceived 
                  in lies and creatures or wickedness, his power passed into 
                  them and was dispersed, and he himself became ever more 
                  earth-bound, unwilling to issue from his dark strongholds. Cf. 
                  also Annals §128 (p. 110). - The expression 'the Morgoth' is 
                  used several times by Finrod in the Athrabeth.<BR>Note 3. The 
                  square brackets were put in after the writing of the 
                  passage.<BR>Note 4. 'his plans for redress': i.e. redress of 
                  the evils he has brought about.<BR>Note 5. The second passage 
                  in QS, in which the pardon of Melkor is recounted (p. 186, 
                  §48), was changed in the final rewriting of Chapter 6: see p. 
                  273, §48. But though :he changed text intro-duced the ideas 
                  that any complete reversal of the evils brought about by 
                  Melkor was impossible, and that be was 'in his beginning the 
                  greatest of the Powers', the narrative was not altered in 
                  respect of changes envisaged in this essay (see note 
                  7).<BR>Note 6. Alteration to the old story of the encounter at 
                  Utumno might have entered if QS Chapter 3 (in which this is 
                  recounted) had formed a part of the late rewriting that 
                  transformed the old Chapter 6; but see note 7.<BR>Note 7. In 
                  the final rewriting of QS Chapter 6 (p. 273, §48) this 
                  remained the case (note 5); and the original story was also 
                  retained that it was in Valinor after his imprisonment, not at 
                  Utumno, that Melkor made his promises of service and 
                  reparation. This might suggest that the present essay was 
                  written after the new work on QS (almost certainly dating from 
                  the end of the 1950s, p. 300), supporting the idea that the 
                  date of the documents on which the essay was written (1955) is 
                  misleading (see p. 385).</FONT></P>

                  (HME 10)/5:7. Myths Transformed. Notes on motives in the 
                  Silmarillion. /Autocomm./ <BR><BR>VII<BR>This essay is found 
                  in two forms. The earlier ('A') is a fairly brief text of four 
                  pages in manuscript, titled 'Some notes on the "philosophy" of 
                  the Silmarillion' it is rapidly expressed and does not have a 
                  clear ending. The second ('B') is a greatly expanded version 
                  of twelve pages, also in manuscript, of far more careful 
                  expression and beginning in fine script, but breaking off 
                  unfinished, indeed in the middle of a sentence. This is titled 
                  'Notes on motives in the Silmarillion'.<BR>The relation 
                  between the two forms is such that for most of its length 
                  there is no need to give any of the text of A, for all of its 
                  content is found embedded in B. From the point (p. 401) where 
                  the Valar are condemned for the raising of the Pelori, 
                  however, the texts diverge. In B my father introduced a long 
                  palliation of the conduct of the Valar, and the essay breaks 
                  off before the matter of the concluding section of A was 
                  reached (see note 6); this is therefore given at the end of 
                  B.<BR>The text of B was subsequently divided and lettered as 
                  three distinct sections, here numbered (i), (ii), and 
                  (iii).<BR>Notes on motives in the 
                  Silmarillion<BR>(i)<BR>Sauron was 'greater', effectively, in 
                  the Second Age than Morgoth at the end of the First. Why? 
                  Because, though he was far smaller by natural stature, he had 
                  not yet fallen so low. Eventually he also squandered his power 
                  (of being) in the endeavour to gain control of others. But he 
                  was not obliged to expend so much of himself. To gain 
                  domination over Arda, Morgoth had let most of his being pass 
                  into the physical constituents of the Earth – hence all things 
                  that were born on Earth and lived on and by it, beasts or 
                  plants or incarnate spirits, were liable to be 'stained'. 
                  Morgoth at the time of the War of the Jewels had become 
                  permanently 'incarnate': for this reason he was afraid, and 
                  waged the war almost entirely by means of devices, or of 
                  subordinates and dominated creatures.<BR>Sauron, however, 
                  inherited the 'corruption' of Arda, and only spent his (much 
                  more limited) power on the Rings; for it was the creatures of 
                  earth, in their minds and wills, that he desired to dominate. 
                  In this way Sauron was also wiser than Melkor-Morgoth. Sauron 
                  was not a beginner of discord; and he probably knew more of 
                  the 'Music' than did Melkor, whose mind had always been filled 
                  with his own plans and devices, and gave little attention to 
                  other things. The time of Melkor's greatest power, therefore, 
                  was in the physical beginnings of the World; a vast demiurgic 
                  lust for power and the achievement of his own will and 
                  designs, on a great scale. And later after things had become 
                  more stable, Melkor was more interested in and capable of 
                  dealing with a volcanic eruption, for example, than with (say) 
                  a tree. It is indeed probable that he was simply unaware of 
                  the minor or more delicate productions of Yavanna: such as 
                  small flowers. *<BR>Thus, as 'Morgoth', when Melkor was 
                  confronted by the existence of other inhabitants of Arda, with 
                  other wills and intelligences, he was enraged by the mere fact 
                  of their existence, and his only notion of dealing with them 
                  was by physical force, or the fear of it. His sole ultimate 
                  object was their destruction. Elves, and still more Men, he 
                  despised because of their 'weakness': that is their lack of 
                  physical force, or power over 'matter'; but he was also afraid 
                  of them. He was aware, at any rate originally when still 
                  capable of rational thought, that he could not 'annihilate'** 
                  them: that is, destroy their being; but their physical life', 
                  and incarnate form became increasingly to his mind the only 
                  thing that was worth considering. *** Or he became so far 
                  advanced in Lying that he lied even to himself, and pretended 
                  that he could destroy them and rid Arda of them altogether. 
                  Hence his endeavour always to break wills and subordinate them 
                  to or absorb them into his own will and being, before 
                  destroying their bodies. This was sheer nihilism, and negation 
                  its one ultimate object: Morgoth would no doubt, if he had 
                  been victorious, have ultimately destroyed even his own 
                  'creatures', such as the Orcs, when they had served his sole 
                  purpose in using them: the destruction of Elves and Men. 
                  Melkor's final impotence and despair lay in this: that whereas 
                  the Valar (and in their degree Elves and Men) could still love 
                  'Arda Marred', that is Arda with a Melkor-ingredient, and 
                  could still heal this or that hurt, or produce from its very 
                  marring, from its state as it was, things beautiful and 
                  lovely, Melkor could do nothing with Arda, which was not from 
                  his own mind and was interwoven with the work and thoughts of 
                  others: even left alone he could only have gone raging on till 
                  all was levelled again into a formless chaos. And yet even so 
                  he would have been defeated, because it would still have 
                  'existed' independent of his own mind, and a world in 
                  potential.<BR>Sauron had never reached this stage of 
                  nihilistic madness. He did not object to the existence of the 
                  world, so long as he could do what he liked with it. He still 
                  had the relics of positive purposes, that descended from the 
                  good of the nature in which he began: it had been his virtue 
                  (and therefore also the cause of his fall, and of his relapse) 
                  that he loved order and co-ordination, and disliked all 
                  confusion and wasteful friction.(It was the apparent will and 
                  power of Melkor to effect his designs quickly and masterfully 
                  that had first attracted Sauron to him.) Sauron had, in fact, 
                  been very like Saruman, and so still understood him quickly 
                  and could guess what he would be likely to think and do, even 
                  without the aid of palantiri or of spies; whereas Gandalf 
                  eluded and puzzled him. But like all minds of this cast, 
                  Sauron's love (originally) or (later) mere understanding of 
                  other individual intelligences was correspondingly weaker; and 
                  though the only real good in, or rational motive for, all this 
                  ordering and planning and organization was the good of all 
                  inhabitants of Arda (even admitting Sauron's right to be their 
                  supreme lord), his 'plans', the idea coming from his own 
                  isolated mind, became the sole object of his will, and an end, 
                  the End, in itself. ****<BR>Morgoth had no 'plan': unless 
                  destruction and reduction to nil of a world in which he had 
                  only a share can be called a 'plan'. But this is, of course, a 
                  simplification of the situation. Sauron had not served 
                  Morgoth, even in his last stages, without becoming infected by 
                  his lust for destruction, and his hatred of God (which must 
                  end in nihilism). Sauron could not, of course, be a 'sincere' 
                  atheist. Though one of the minor spirits created before the 
                  world, he knew Eru, according to his measure. He probably 
                  deluded himself with the notion that the Valar (including 
                  Melkor) having failed, Eru had simply abandoned Eд, or at any 
                  rate Arda, and would not concern himself with it any more. It 
                  would appear that he interpreted the 'change of the world' at 
                  the Downfall of Numenor, when Aman was removed from the 
                  physical world, in this sense: Valar (and Elves) were removed 
                  from effective control, and Men under God's curse and wrath. 
                  If he thought about the Istari, especially Saruman and 
                  Gandalf, he imagined them as emissaries from the Valar, 
                  seeking to establish their lost power again and 'colonize' 
                  Middle-earth, as a mere effort of defeated imperialists 
                  (without knowledge or sanction of Eru). His cynicism, which 
                  (sincerely) regarded the motives of Manwл as precisely the 
                  same as his own, seemed fully justified in Saruman. Gandalf he 
                  did not understand. But certainly he had already become evil, 
                  and therefore stupid, enough to imagine that his different 
                  behaviour was due simply to weaker intelligence and lack of 
                  firm masterful purpose. He was only a rather cleverer Radagast 
                  - cleverer, because it is more profitable (more productive of 
                  power) to become absorbed in the study of people than of 
                  animals.<BR>Sauron was not a 'sincere' atheist, but he 
                  preached atheism, because it weakened resistance to himself 
                  (and he had ceased to fear God's action in Arda). As was seen 
                  in the case of Ar-Pharazфn. But there was seen the effect of 
                  Melkor upon Sauron: he spoke of Melkor in Melkor's own terms: 
                  as a god, or even as God. This may have been the residue of a 
                  state which was in a sense a shadow of good: the ability once 
                  in Sauron at least to admire or admit the superiority of a 
                  being other than himself. Melkor, and still more Sauron 
                  himself afterwards, both profited by this darkened shadow of 
                  good and the services of 'worshippers'. But it may be doubted 
                  whether even such a shadow of good was still sincerely 
                  operative in Sauron by that time. His cunning motive is 
                  probably best expressed thus. To wean one of the God-fearing 
                  from their allegiance it is best to propound another unseen 
                  object of allegiance and another hope of benefits; propound to 
                  him a Lord who will sanction what he desires and not forbid 
                  it. Sauron, apparently a defeated rival for world-power, now a 
                  mere hostage, can hardly propound himself; but as the former 
                  servant and disciple of Melkor, the worship of Melkor will 
                  raise him from hostage to high priest. But though Sauron's 
                  whole true motive was the destruction of the Nъmenуreans, this 
                  was a particular matter of revenge upon Ar-Pharazфn, for 
                  humiliation. Sauron (unlike Morgoth) would have been content 
                  for the Nъmenуreans to exist, as his own subjects, and indeed 
                  he used a great many of them that he corrupted to his 
                  allegiance.<BR><BR>* [footnote to the text] If such things 
                  were forced upon his attention, he was angry and hated them, 
                  as coming from other minds than his own.<BR>** [bracketed note 
                  inserted into the text] Melkor could not, of course, 
                  'annihilate' anything of matter, he could only ruin or destroy 
                  or corrupt the forms given to matter by other minds in their 
                  subcreative activities.<BR>*** [footnote without indication of 
                  reference in the text] For this reason he himself came to fear 
                  'death' - the destruction of his assumed bodily form - above 
                  everything, and sought to avoid any kind injury to his own 
                  form.<BR>**** [Footnote to the text] But his capability of 
                  corrupting other minds, and even engaging their service, was a 
                  residue from the fact that his original desire for 'order' had 
                  really envisaged the good estate, specially physical 
                  well-being) of his 'subjects'.</FONT></P>

                  one, not even one of the Valar, can read the mind of other 
                  'equal beings': * that is one cannot 'see' them or comprehend 
                  them fully and directly by simple inspection. One can deduce 
                  much of their thought, from general comparisons leading to 
                  conclusions concerning the nature and tendencies of minds and 
                  thought, and from particular knowledge of individuals, and 
                  special circumstances. But this is no more reading or 
                  inspection of another mind than is deduction concerning the 
                  contents of a closed room, or events taken place out of sight. 
                  Neither is so-called 'thought-transference' a process of 
                  mind-reading: this is but the reception, and interpretation by 
                  the receiving mind, of the impact of a thought, or 
                  thought-pattern, emanating from another mind, which is no more 
                  the mind in full or in itself than is the distant sight of a 
                  man running the man himself. Minds can exhibit or reveal 
                  themselves to other minds by the action of their own wills 
                  (though it is doubtful if, even when willing or desiring this, 
                  a mind can actually reveal itself wholly to any other mind). 
                  It is thus a temptation to minds of greater power to govern or 
                  constrain the will of other, and weaker, minds, so as to 
                  induce or force them to reveal themselves. But to force such a 
                  revelation, or to induce it by any lying or deception, even 
                  for supposedly 'good' purposes (including the 'good' of the 
                  person so persuaded or dominated), is absolutely forbidden. To 
                  do so is a crime, and the 'good' in the purposes of those who 
                  commit this crime swiftly becomes corrupted. Much could thus 
                  'go on behind Manwл's back': indeed the innermost being of all 
                  other minds, great and small, was hidden from him. And with 
                  regard to the Enemy, Melkor, in particular, he could not 
                  penetrate by distant mind-sight his thought and purposes, 
                  since Melkor remained in a fixed and powerful will to withhold 
                  his mind: which physically expressed took shape in the 
                  darkness and shadows that surrounded him. But Manwл could of 
                  course use, and did use, his own great knowledge his vast 
                  experience of things and of persons, his memory of the 
                  'Music', and his own far sight, and the tidings of his 
                  messengers.<BR>He, like Melkor, practically never is seen or 
                  heard of outside or far away from his own halls and permanent 
                  residence. Why is this? For no very profound reason. The 
                  Government is always in Whitehall. King Arthur is usually in 
                  Camelot or Caerleon and news and adventures come there and 
                  arise there. The 'Elder King' is obviously not going to be 
                  finally defeated or destroyed at least not before some 
                  ultimate 'Ragnarцk' (1) – which even for us is still in the 
                  future, so he can have no real 'adventures'. But if you keep 
                  him at home, the issue of any particular event (since it 
                  cannot then result in a final 'checkmate') can remain in 
                  literary suspense. Even to the final war against Morgoth it is 
                  Fionwл son of Manwл who leads out the power of the Valar. When 
                  we move out Manwл it will be the last battle, and the end of 
                  the World (or of 'Arda Marred') as the Eldar would 
                  say.<BR>[Morgoth's staying 'at home' has, as described above, 
                  quite a different reason: his fear of being killed or even 
                  hurt (the literary motive is not present, for since he is 
                  pitted against the Elder King, the issue of any one of his 
                  enterprises is always in doubt).]<BR>Melkor 'incarnated' 
                  himself (as Morgoth) permanently. He did this so as to control 
                  the hroa,(2) the 'flesh' or physical matter of Arda. He 
                  attempted to identify himself with it. A vaster and more 
                  perilous, procedure, though of similar sort to the operations 
                  of Sauron with the Rings. Thus, outside the Blessed Realm, all 
                  'matter' was likely to have a 'Melkor ingredient', (3) and 
                  those who had bodies, nourished by the hroa of Arda, had as it 
                  were a tendency, small or great, towards Melkor: they were 
                  none of them wholly free of him in their incarnate form, and 
                  their bodies had an effect upon their spirits.<BR>But in this 
                  way Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater 
                  part of his original 'angelic' powers, of mind and spirit, 
                  while gaining a terrible grip upon the physical world. For 
                  this reason he had to be fought, mainly by physical force, and 
                  enormous material ruin was a probable consequence of any 
                  direct combat with him, victorious or otherwise. This is the 
                  chief explanation of the constant reluctance of the Valar to 
                  come into open battle against Morgoth. Manwл's task and 
                  problem was much more difficult than Gandalf's. Sauron's, 
                  relatively smaller, power was concentrated; Morgoth's vast 
                  power was disseminated. The whole of 'Middle-earth' was 
                  Morgoth's Ring, though temporarily his attention was mainly 
                  upon the North-west. Unless swiftly successful, War against 
                  him might well end in reducing all Middle-earth to chaos, 
                  possibly even all Arda. It is easy to say: 'It was the task 
                  and function of the Elder King to govern Arda and make it 
                  possible for the Children of Eru to live in it unmolested.' 
                  But the dilemma of the Valar was this: Arda could only be 
                  liberated by a physical battle; but a probable result of such 
                  a battle was the irretrievable ruin of Arda. Moreover, the 
                  final eradication of Sauron (as a power directing evil) was 
                  achievable by the destruction of the Ring. No such eradication 
                  of Morgoth was possible, since this required the complete 
                  disintegration of the 'matter' of Arda. Sauron's power was not 
                  (for example) in gold as such, but in a particular form or 
                  shape made of a particular portion of total gold. Morgoth's 
                  power was disseminated throughout Gold, if nowhere absolute 
                  (for he did not create Gold) it was nowhere absent. (It was 
                  this Morgoth-element in matter, indeed, which was a 
                  prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils as Sauron 
                  practised with it and upon it.)<BR>It is quite possible, of 
                  course, that certain 'elements' or conditions of matter had 
                  attracted Morgoth's special attention (mainly, unless in the 
                  remote past, for reasons of his own plans). For example, all 
                  gold (in Middle-earth) seems to have had a specially 'evil' 
                  trend - but not silver. Water is represented as being almost 
                  entirely free of Morgoth. (This, of course, does not mean that 
                  any particular sea, stream, river, well, or even vessel of 
                  water could not be poisoned or defiled - as all things 
                  could.)<BR>* [marginal note] All rational minds / spirits 
                  deriving direct from Eru are 'equal' -– in order and status – 
                  though not necessarily 'coлval' or of like original 
                  power.<BR><BR>Note 1. Ragnarцk: 'the Doom of the Gods' (Old 
                  Norse): see IX.286.<BR>Note 2. hroa: so written here and at 
                  the second occurrence below (and in text A), not as elsewhere 
                  always hrцa, where it means the body of an incarnate being. 
                  The word used for 'physical matter' in Laws and Customs was 
                  hron, later changed to orma (p. 2 18 and note 26); in the 
                  Commentary on the Athrabeth and in the 'Glossary' of names the 
                  word is erma (pp. 338, 349).<BR>Note 3. On this sentence see 
                  p. 271.<BR>(iii) <BR>The Valar 'fade' and become more 
                  impotent, precisely in proportion as the shape and 
                  constitution of things becomes more defined and settled. The 
                  longer the Past, the more nearly defined the Future, and the 
                  less room for important change (untrammelled action, on a 
                  physical plane, that is not destructive in purpose). The Past, 
                  once 'achieved', has become part of the 'Music in being'. Only 
                  Eru may or can alter the 'Music'. The last major effort, of 
                  this demiurgic kind, made by the Valar was the lifting up of 
                  the range of the Pelori to a great height. It is possible to 
                  view this as, if not an actually bad action, at least as a 
                  mistaken one. Ulmo disapproved of it. (1) It had one good, and 
                  legitimate, object: the preservation incorrupt of at least a 
                  part of Arda. But it seemed to have a selfish or neglectful 
                  (or despairing) motive also; for the effort to preserve the 
                  Elves incorrupt there had proved a failure if they were to be 
                  left free: many had refused to come to the Blessed Realm, many 
                  had revolted and left it. Whereas, with regard to Men, Manwл 
                  and all the Valar knew quite well that they could not come to 
                  Aman at all; and the longevity (co-extensive with the life of 
                  Arda) of Valar and Eldar was expressly not permitted to Men. 
                  Thus the 'Hiding of Valinor' came near to countering Morgoth's 
                  possessiveness by a rival possessiveness, setting up a private 
                  domain of light and bliss against one of darkness and 
                  domination: a palace and a pleasaunce (2) (well-fenced) 
                  against a fortress and a dungeon. (3)<BR>This appearance of 
                  selfish fainйance in the Valar in the mythology as told is 
                  (though I have not explained it or commented on it) I think 
                  only an 'appearance', and one which we are apt to accept as 
                  the truth, since we are all in some degree affected by the 
                  shadow and lies of their Enemy, the Calumniator. It has to be 
                  remembered that the 'mythology' is repre-sented as being two 
                  stages removed from a true record: it is based first upon 
                  Elvish records and lore about the Valar and their own dealings 
                  with them; and these have reached us (fragmentarily) only 
                  through relics of Nъmenуrean (human) traditions, derived from 
                  the Eldar, in the earlier parts, though for later times 
                  supplemented by anthropocentric histories and tales. (4) 
                  These, it is true, came down through the 'Faithful' and their 
                  descendants in Middle-earth, but could not altogether escape 
                  the darkening of the picture due to the hostility of the 
                  rebellious Nъmenуreans to the Valar.<BR>Even so, and on the 
                  grounds of the stories as received, it is possible to view the 
                  matter otherwise. The closing of Valinor against the rebel 
                  Noldor (who left it voluntarily and after warning) was in 
                  itself just. But, if we dare to attempt to enter the mind of 
                  the Elder King, assigning motives and finding faults, there 
                  are things to remember before we deliver a judgement. Manwл 
                  was the spirit of greatest wisdom and prudence in Arda. He is 
                  represented as having had the greatest knowledge of the Music, 
                  as a whole, possessed by any one finite mind; and he alone of 
                  all persons or minds in that time is represented as having the 
                  power of direct recourse to and communication with Eru. He 
                  must have grasped with great clarity what even we may perceive 
                  dimly: that it was the essential mode of the process of 
                  'history' in Arda that evil should constantly arise, and that 
                  out of it new good should constantly come. One especial aspect 
                  of this is the strange way in which the evils of the Marrer, 
                  or his inheritors, are turned into weapons against evil. If we 
                  consider the situation after the escape of Morgoth and the 
                  reestablish-ment of his abode in Middle-earth, we shall see 
                  that the heroic Noldor were the best possible weapon with 
                  which to keep Morgoth at bay, virtually besieged, and at any 
                  rate fully occupied, on the northern fringe of Middle-earth, 
                  without provoking him to a frenzy of nihilistic destruction. 
                  And in the meanwhile, Men, or the best elements in Mankind, 
                  shaking off his shadow, came into contact with a people who 
                  had actually seen and experi-enced the Blessed Realm.<BR>In 
                  their association with the warring Eldar Men were raised to 
                  their fullest achievable stature, and by the two marriages the 
                  transference to them, or infusion into Mankind, of the noblest 
                  Elf-strain was accomplished, in readiness for the still 
                  distant, but inevitably approaching, days when the Elves would 
                  'fade'.<BR>The last intervention with physical force by the 
                  Valar, ending in the breaking of Thangorodrim, may then be 
                  viewed as not in fact reluctant or even unduly delayed, but 
                  timed with precision. The intervention came before the 
                  annihilation of the Eldar and the Edain. Morgoth though 
                  locally triumphant had neglected most of Middle-earth during 
                  the war; and by it he had in fact been weakened: in power and 
                  prestige (he had lost and failed to recover one of the 
                  Silmarils), and above all in mind. He had become absorbed in 
                  'kingship', and though a tyrant of ogre-size and monstrous 
                  power, this was a vast fall even from his former wickedness of 
                  hate, and his terrible nihilism. He had fallen to like being a 
                  tyrant-king with conquered slaves, and vast obedient armies.

                  <P><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size=2>The war was 
                  successful, and ruin was limited to the small (if beautiful) 
                  region of Beleriand. Morgoth was thus actually made captive in 
                  physical form, (6) and in that form taken as a mere criminal 
                  to Aman and delivered to Nбmo Mandos as judge – and 
                  executioner. He was judged, and eventually taken out of the 
                  Blessed Realm and executed: that is killed like one of the 
                  Incarnates. It was then made plain (though it must have been 
                  understood beforehand by Manwл and Nбmo) that, though he had 
                  'disseminated' his power (his evil and possessive and 
                  rebellious will) far and wide into the matter of Arda, he had 
                  lost direct control of this, and all that 'he', as a surviving 
                  remnant of integral being, retained as 'himself and under 
                  control was the terribly shrunken and reduced spirit that 
                  inhabited his self-imposed (but now beloved) body. When that 
                  body was destroyed he was weak and utterly 'houseless', and 
                  for that time at a loss and 'unanchored' as it were. We read 
                  that he was then thrust out into the Void. (7) That should 
                  mean that he was put outside Time and Space, outside Eд 
                  altogether; but if that were so this would imply a direct 
                  intervention of Eru (with or without supplication of the 
                  Valar). It may however refer inaccurately* to the extrusion or 
                  flight of his spirit from Arda.<BR>In any case, in seeking to 
                  absorb or rather to infiltrate himself throughout 'matter', 
                  what was then left of him was no longer powerful enough to 
                  reclothe itself. (It would now remain fixed in the desire to 
                  do so: there was no 'repentance' or possibility of it: Melkor 
                  had abandoned for ever all 'spiritual' ambitions, and existed 
                  almost solely as a desire to possess and dominate matter, and 
                  Arda in particular.) At least it could not yet reclothe 
                  itself. We need not suppose that Manwл was deluded into 
                  supposing that this had been a war to end war, or even to end 
                  Melkor. Melkor was not Sauron. We speak of him being 
                  'weakened, shrunken, reduced'; but this is in comparison with 
                  the great Valar. He had been a being of immense potency and 
                  life. The Elves certainly held and taught that fear or 
                  'spirits' may grow of their own life (independently of the 
                  body), even as they may be hurt and healed, be diminished and 
                  renewed. (8) The dark spirit of Melkor's 'remainder' might be 
                  expected, therefore, eventually and after long ages to 
                  increase again, even (as some held) to draw back into itself 
                  some of its formerly dissipated power. It would do this (even 
                  if Sauron could not) because of its relative greatness. It did 
                  not repent, or turn finally away from its obsession, but 
                  retained still relics of wisdom, so that it could still seek 
                  its object indirectly, and not merely blindly. It would rest, 
                  seek to heal itself, distract itself by other thoughts and 
                  desires and devices — but all simply to recover enough 
                  strength to return to the attack on the Valar, and to its old 
                  obsession. As it grew again it would become, as it were, a 
                  dark shadow, breeding on the confines of Arda, and yearning 
                  towards it.<BR>Nonetheless the breaking of Thangorodrim and 
                  the extrusion of Melkor was the end of 'Morgoth' as such, and 
                  for that age (and many ages after). It was thus, also, in a 
                  sense the end of Manwл's prime function and task as Elder 
                  King, until the End. He had been the Adversary of the 
                  Enemy.<BR>It is very reasonable to suppose that Manwл knew 
                  that before long (as he saw 'time') the Dominion of Men must 
                  begin, and the making of history would then be committed to 
                  them: for their struggle with Evil special arrangements had 
                  been made! Manwл knew of Sauron, of course. He had commanded 
                  Sauron to come before him for judgement, but had left room for 
                  repentance and ultimate rehabilitation. Sauron had refused and 
                  had fled into hiding. Sauron, however, was a problem that Men 
                  had to deal with finally: the first of the many concentrations 
                  of Evil into definite power-points that they would have to 
                  combat, as it was also the last of those in 'mythological' 
                  personalized (but non-human) form.<BR>It may be noted that 
                  Sauron's first defeat was achieved by the Nъmenуreans alone 
                  (though Sauron was not in fact overthrown personally: his 
                  'captivity' was voluntary and a trick). In the first overthrow 
                  and disembodiment of Sauron in Middle-earth (neglecting the 
                  matter of Lъthien) (9)<BR>Here the long version B breaks off, 
                  at the foot of a page. I give now the conclusion of version A 
                  from the point where the texts diverge (see p. 394 and note 
                  6), beginning with the sentence corresponding to B (p. 401) 
                  'The last major effort, of this demiurgic kind, made by the 
                  Valar...'<BR>The last effort of this sort made by the Valar 
                  was the raising up of the Pelori — but this was not a good 
                  act: it came near to countering Morgoth in his own way - apart 
                  from the element of selfishness in its object of preserving 
                  Aman as a blissful region to live in.<BR>The Valar were like 
                  architects working with a plan 'passed' by the Government. 
                  They became less and less important (structurally!) as the 
                  plan was more and more nearly achieved. Even in the First Age 
                  we see them after uncounted ages of work near the end of their 
                  time of work — not wisdom or counsel. (The wiser they became 
                  the less power they had to do anything — save by 
                  counsel.)<BR>Similarly the Elves faded, having introduced 'art 
                  and science'. (10) Men will also 'fade', if it proves to be 
                  the plan that things shall still go on, when they have 
                  completed their function. But even the Elves had the notion 
                  that this would not be so: that the end of Men would somehow 
                  be bound up with the end of history, or as they called it 
                  'Arda Marred' (Arda Sahta), and the achievement of 'Arda 
                  Healed' (Arda Envinyanta). (11) (They do not seem to have been 
                  clear or precise - how should they be! - whether Arda 
                  Envinyanta was a permanent state of achievement, which could 
                  therefore only be enjoyed 'outside Time', as it were: 
                  surveying the Tale as an englobed whole; or a state of 
                  unmarred bliss within Time and in a 'place' that was in some 
                  sense a lineal and historical descent of our world or 'Arda 
                  Marred'. They seem often to have meant both. 'Arda Unmarred' 
                  did not actually exist, but remained in thought - Arda without 
                  Melkor, or rather without the effects of his becoming evil; 
                  but is the source from which all ideas of order and perfection 
                  are derived. 'Arda Healed' is thus both the completion of the 
                  'Tale of Arda' which has taken up all the deeds of Melkor, but 
                  must according to the promise of Iluvatar be seen to be good; 
                  and also a state of redress and bliss beyond the 'circles of 
                  the world'.) (12)<BR>Evil is fissiparous. But itself barren. 
                  Melkor could not 'beget', or have any spouse (though he 
                  attempted to ravish Arien, this was to destroy and 'distain' 
                  (13) her, not to beget fiery offspring). Out of the discords 
                  of the Music — sc. not directly out of either of the themes, 
                  (14) Eru's or Melkor's, but of their dissonance with regard 
                  one to another - evil things appeared in Arda, which did not 
                  descend from any direct plan or vision of Melkor: they were 
                  not 'his children'; and therefore, since all evil hates, hated 
                  him too. The progeniture of things was corrupted. Hence Orcs? 
                  Part of the Elf-Man idea gone wrong. Though as for Orcs, the 
                  Eldar believed Morgoth had actually 'bred' them by capturing 
                  Men , (and Elves) early and increasing to the utmost any 
                  corrupt tendencies they possessed.<BR>Despite its incomplete 
                  state (whether due to the loss of the conclusion of the fully 
                  developed form of the essay or to its abandonment, see note 6) 
                  this is the most comprehensive account that my father wrote of 
                  how, in his later years, he had come to 'interpret' the nature 
                  of Evil in his mythology; never elsewhere did he write any 
                  such exposition of the nature of Morgoth, of his decline, and 
                  of his corruption of Arda, nor draw out the distinction 
                  between Morgoth and Sauron: 'the whole of Middle-earth was 
                  Morgoth's Ring'.<BR>To place this essay in sequential relation 
                  to the other 'philosophical' or 'theological' writings given 
                  in this book with any certainty seems scarcely possible, 
                  though 'Fionwл son of Manwл' on p. 399 (for 'Лonwл herald of 
                  Manwл') may suggest that it stands relatively early among them 
                  (see pp. 151-2). It shows a marked likeness in tone to the 
                  many letters of exposition that my father wrote in the later 
                  1950s, and indeed it seems to me very possible that the 
                  correspondence which followed the publication of The Lord of 
                  the Rings played a significant part in the development of his 
                  examination of the 'images and events' of the mythology. 
                  (15).<BR><BR>*[footnote to the text] Since the minds of Men 
                  (and even of the Elves) were inclined to confuse the 'Void',

                  condemnation, strongly expressed, of the Valar for the Hiding 
                  of Valinor is found in the story of that name in The Book of 
                  Lost Tales (I.208-9), but disappears in the later versions. Of 
                  the old story I noted (I.223) that 'in The Silmarillion there 
                  is no vestige of the tumultuous council, no suggestion of a 
                  disagreement among the Valar, with Manwл, Varda and Ulmo 
                  actively disapproving the work and holding aloof from it', and 
                  I commented:<BR>It is most curious to observe that the action 
                  of the Valar here sprang essentially from indolence mixed with 
                  fear. Nowhere does my father's early conception of the 
                  fainйant Gods appear more clearly. He held moreover quite 
                  explicitly that their failure to make war upon Melko then and 
                  there was a deep error, diminishing themselves, and (as it 
                  appears) irreparable. In his later writing the Hiding of 
                  Valinor remained indeed, but only as a great fact of 
                  mythological antiquity; there is no whisper of its 
                  condemnation.<BR>The last words refer to the actual 
                  Silmarillion narratives. Ulmo's disapproval now reappears, and 
                  is a further evidence of his isolation in the counsels of the 
                  Valar (see p. 253 note II); cf. his words to Tuor at Vinyamar 
                  (having spoken to him, among other things, of 'the hiding of 
                  the Blessed Realm', though what he said is not told): 
                  'Therefore, though in the days of this darkness I seem to 
                  oppose the will of my brethren, the Lords of the West, that is 
                  my part among them, to which I was appointed ere the making of 
                  the World' {Unfinished Tales p. 29).<BR>Note 2. pleasaunce (= 
                  pleasance): a 'pleasure-garden'. My father used this word 
                  several times in The Book of Lost Tales (see 1.275, 
                  pleasance), for example of the gardens of Lorien. <BR>Note 3. 
                  At this point my father wrote on the manuscript later: 'See 
                  original short form on Fading of Elves (and Men)'. See p. 394. 
                  This seems a clear indication that B was not completed, or 
                  that if it was its conclusion was early lost.<BR>Note 4. Cf. 
                  the statement on this subject in the brief text I, p. 
                  370.<BR>Note 5. Since this discussion is introduced in 
                  justification of the Hiding of Valinor, the bearing of the 
                  argument seems to be that the history of Middle-earth in the 
                  last centuries of the First Age would not have been possible 
                  of achievement had Valinor remained open to the return of the 
                  Noldor.<BR>Note 6. As, of course, had happened to Melkor long 
                  before, after the sack of Utumno.<BR>Note 7. Cf. the 
                  conclusion of QS (V.332, §29): 'But Morgoth himself the Gods 
                  thrust through the Door of Night into the Timeless Void, 
                  beyond the Walls of the World'.<BR>Note 8. The following was 
                  added marginally after the page was written: <BR>If they do 
                  not sink below a certain level. Since no fлa can be 
                  annihilated, reduced to zero or not-existing, it is no[t] 
                  clear what is meant. Thus Sauron was said to have fallen below 
                  the point of ever recovering, though he had previously 
                  recovered. What is probably meant is that a 'wicked' spirit 
                  becomes fixed in a certain desire or ambition, and if it 
                  cannot repent then this desire becomes virtually its whole 
                  being. But the desire may be wholly beyond the weakness it has 
                  fallen to, and it will then be unable to withdraw its 
                  attention from the unobtainable desire, even to attend to 
                  itself. It will then remain for ever in impotent desire or 
                  memory of desire.<BR>Note 9. A reference to the legend of the 
                  defeat of Sauron by Luthien and Huan on the isle of 
                  Tol-in-Gaurhoth, where Beren was imprisoned {The Silmarillion 
                  pp. 174—5).<BR>Note 10. Cf. Letters no.181 (1956): 'In this 
                  mythological world the Elves and Men are in their incarnate 
                  forms kindred, but in the relation of their "spirits" to the 
                  world in time represent different "experiments", each of which 
                  has its own natural trend, and weakness. The Elves represent, 
                  as it were, the artistic, aesthetic, and purely scientific 
                  aspects of the Humane nature raised to a higher level than is 
                  actually seen in Men.' <BR>Note 11. In the text FM 2 of 'Finwл 
                  and Mнriel' (p. 254, footnote) 'Arda Marred' is Arda Hastaina. 
                  Arda Envinyanta, at both occurrences, was first written Arda 
                  Vincarna.<BR>Note 12. With this passage in brackets cf. 
                  especially note (iii) at the end of Laws and Customs (p. 251); 
                  also pp. 245,254 (footnote), 318<BR>Note 13. distain', an 
                  archaic verb meaning 'stain', 'discolour', 'defile'. <BR>Note 
                  14. The Three Themes of Iluvatar in the Music of the Ainur are 
                  here treated as a single theme, in opposition to the 
                  discordant 'theme' of Melkor.<BR>Note 15. In a letter of June 
                  1957 (Letters no.200) he wrote: I am sorry if this all seems 
                  dreary and 'pompose'. But so do all attempts to 'explain' the 
                  images and events of a mythology. Naturally the stories come 
                  first. But it is, I suppose, some test of the consistency of a 
                  mythology as such, if it is capable of some sort of rational 
                  or rationalized explanation.</FONT></P>

                  (HME 10)/5:8. Myths Transformed. Orcs. /Autocomm./ 
                  <BR>VIII<BR>In the last sentence of the original short version 
                  of text VII (p. 406) my father wrote that the Eldar believed 
                  that Morgoth bred the Orcs 'by capturing Men (and Elves) 
                  early' (i.e. in the early days of their existence). This 
                  indicates that his views on this subject had changed since the 
                  Annals of Aman. For the theory of the origin of the Orcs as it 
                  stood, in point of written record in the narratives, (1) at 
                  this time see AAm §42-5 (pp. 72-4, and commentary p. 78 / 
                  Fr.161/), and §127 (pp. 109-10 / Fr.162a/, and commentary pp. 
                  123-4 / Fr.162 b/). In the final form in AAm (p. 74 / Fr.161/) 
                  'this is held true by the wise of Eressлa': <BR>all those of 
                  the Quendi that came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was 
                  broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty 
                  and wickedness were corrupted and enslaved. Thus did Melkor 
                  breed the hideous race of the Orkor in envy and mockery of the 
                  Eldar, of whom they were afterwards the bitterest foes. For 
                  the Orkor had life and multiplied after the manner of the 
                  Children of Iluvatar; and naught that had life of its own, nor 
                  the semblance thereof, could ever Melkor make since his 
                  rebellion in the Ainulindalл before the Beginning: so say the 
                  wise.<BR>On the typescript of AAm my father noted against the 
                  account of the origin of the Orcs: 'Alter this. Orcs are not 
                  Elvish' (p. 80) / Fr.161/.<BR>The present text, entitled 
                  'Orcs', is a short essay (very much a record of 'thinking with 
                  the pen') found in the same small collection gathered in a 
                  newspaper of 1959 as texts III and VI. Like them it was 
                  written on Merton College papers of 1955; and like text VI it 
                  makes reference to 'Finrod and Andreth' (see pp. 385, 
                  390).<BR>Orcs<BR>Their nature and origin require more thought. 
                  They are not easy to work into the theory and system.<BR>(1) 
                  As the case of Aulл and the Dwarves shows, only Eru could make 
                  creatures with independent wills, and with reasoning powers. 
                  But Orcs seem to have both: they can try to cheat Morgoth / 
                  Sauron, rebel against him, or criticize him.<BR>(2) ? 
                  Therefore they must be corruptions of something 
                  pre-existing.<BR>(3) But Men had not yet appeared, when the 
                  Orcs already existed. Aulл constructed the Dwarves out of his 
                  memory of the Music; but Eru would not sanction the work of 
                  Melkor so as to allow the independence of the Orcs. (Not 
                  unless Orcs were ultimately remediable, or could be amended 
                  and 'saved'?)<BR>It also seems clear (see 'Finrod and 
                  Andreth') that though Melkor could utterly corrupt and ruin 
                  individuals, it is not possible to contemplate his absolute 
                  perversion of a whole people, or group of peoples, and his 
                  making that state heritable. (2) [Added later: This latter 
                  must (if a fact) be an act of Eru.]<BR>In that case Elves, as 
                  a source, are very unlikely. And are Orcs 'immortal', in the 
                  Elvish sense? Or trolls? It seems clearly implied in The Lord 
                  of the Rings that trolls existed in their own right, but were 
                  'tinkered' with by Melkor. (3)<BR>(4) What of talking beasts 
                  and birds with reasoning and speech? These have been rather 
                  lightly adopted from less 'serious' mythologies, but play a 
                  part which cannot now be excised. They are certainly 
                  'exceptions' and not much used, but sufficiently to show they 
                  are a recognized feature of the world. All other creatures 
                  accept them as natural if not common.<BR>But true 'rational' 
                  creatures, 'speaking peoples', are all of human / 'humanoid' 
                  form. Only the Valar and Maiar are intelligences that can 
                  assume forms of Arda at will. Huan and Sorontar could be Maiar 
                  - emissaries of Manwл. (4) But unfortu-nately in The Lord of 
                  the Rings Gwaehir and Landroval are said to be descendants of 
                  Sorontar. (5)<BR>In any case is it likely or possible that 
                  even the least of the Maiar would become Orcs? Yes: both 
                  outside Arda and in it, before the fall of Utumno. Melkor had 
                  corrupted many spirits — some great, as Sauron, or less so, as 
                  Balrogs. The least could have been primitive (and much more 
                  powerful and perilous) Orcs; but by practising when embodied 
                  procreation they would (cf. Melian) [become] more and more 
                  earthbound, unable to return to spirit-state (even 
                  demon-form), until released by death (killing), and they would 
                  dwindle in force. When released they would, of course, like 
                  Sauron, be 'damned': i.e. reduced to impotence, infinitely 
                  recessive: still hating but unable more and more to make it 
                  effective physically (or would not a very dwindled dead 
                  Orc-state be a poltergeist?).<BR>But again - would Eru provide 
                  fлar for such creatures? For the Eagles etc. perhaps. But not 
                  for Orcs. (6)<BR>It does however seem best to view Melkor's 
                  corrupting power as always starting, at least, in the moral or 
                  theological level. Any creature that took him for Lord (and 
                  especially those who blasphemously called him Father or 
                  Creator) became soon corrupted in all parts of its being, the 
                  fлa dragging down the hrцa in its descent into Morgothism: 
                  hate and destruction. As for Elves being 'immortal': they in 
                  fact only had enormously long lives, and were themselves 
                  physically 'wearing out', and suffering a slow progressive 
                  weakening of their bodies.<BR>In summary: I think it must be 
                  assumed that 'talking' is not necessarily the sign of the 
                  possession of a 'rational soul' or fлa. (7) The Orcs were 
                  beasts of humanized shape (to mock Men and Elves) deliberately 
                  perverted / converted into a more close resemblance to Men. 
                  Their 'talking' was really reeling off 'records' set in them 
                  by Melkor. Even their rebellious critical words — he knew 
                  about them. Melkor taught them speech and as they bred they 
                  inherited this; and they had just as much independence as 
                  have, say, dogs or horses of their human masters. This talking 
                  was largely echoic (cf. parrots), in The Lord of the Rings 
                  Sauron is said to have devised a language for them. (8)<BR>The 
                  same sort of thing may be said of Huan and the Eagles: they 
                  were taught language by the Valar, and raised to a higher 
                  level - but they still had no fлar.<BR>But Finrod probably 
                  went too far in his assertion that Melkor could not wholly 
                  corrupt any work of Eru, or that Eru would (necessarily) 
                  interfere to abrogate the corruption, or to end the being of 
                  His own creatures because they had been corrupted and fallen 
                  into evil. (9)<BR>It remains therefore terribly possible there 
                  was an Elvish strain in the Orcs. (10) These may then even 
                  have been mated with beasts (sterile!) - and later Men. Their 
                  life-span would be diminished. And dying they would go to 
                  Mandos and be held in prison till the End.<BR>The text as 
                  written ends here, but my father subsequently added the 
                  following passage. The words with which it opens are a 
                  reference to text VI, Melkor Morgoth (p. 390).<BR>See 
                  'Melkor'. It will there be seen that the wills of Orcs and 
                  Balrogs etc. are part of Melkor's power 'dispersed'. Their 
                  spirit is one of hate. But hate is non-coцperative (except 
                  under direct fear). Hence the rebellions, mutinies, etc. when 
                  Morgoth seems far off. Orcs are beasts and Balrogs corrupted 
                  Maiar. Also (n.b.) Morgoth not Sauron is the source of 
                  Orc-wills. Sauron is just another (if greater) agent. Orcs can 
                  rebel against him without losing their own irremediable 
                  allegiance to evil (Morgoth). Aulл wanted love. But of course 
                  had no thought of dispersing his power. Only Eru can give love 
                  and independence. If a finite sub-creator tries to do this he 
                  really wants absolute loving obedience, but it turns into 
                  robotic servitude and becomes evil.<BR><BR>Note 1. In a long 
                  letter to Peter Hastings of September 1954, which was not sent 
                  (Letters no.l53), my father wrote as follows on the question 
                  of whether Orcs 'could have "souls" or "spirits"': <BR>... 
                  since in my myth at any rate I do not conceive of the making 
                  of souls or spirits, things of an equal order if not an equal 
                  power to the Valar, as a possible 'delegation', I have 
                  represented at least the Orcs as pre-existing real beings on 
                  whom the Dark Lord has exerted the fullness of his power in 
                  remodelling and corrupting them, not making them. ... There 
                  might be other 'makings' all the same which were more like 
                  puppets filled (only at a distance) with their maker's mind 
                  and will, or ant-like operating under direction of a 
                  queen-centre. <BR>Earlier in this letter he had quoted Frodo's 
                  words to Sam in the chapter 'The Tower of Cirith Ungol': 'The 
                  Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real 
                  new things of its own. I don't think it gave life to the Orcs, 
                  it only ruined them and twisted them'; and he went on: 'In the 
                  legends of the Elder Days it is suggested that the Diabolus 
                  subjugated and corrupted some of the earliest Elves ...' He 
                  also said that the Orcs 'are fundamentally a race of "rational 
                  incarnate" creatures'.<BR>Note 2. in the Athrabeth (p. 312) 
                  Finrod declared: <BR>But never even in the night have we 
                  believed that [Melkor] could prevail against the Children of 
                  Eru. This one he might cozen, or that one he might corrupt; 
                  but to change the doom of a whole people of the Children, to 
                  rob them of their inherit-ance: if he could do that in Eru's 
                  despite, then greater and more terrible is he by far than we 
                  guessed ..<BR>Note 3. In The Lord of the Rings Appendix F (1) 
                  it is said of Trolls: <BR>In their beginning far back in the 
                  twilight of the Elder Days, these were creatures of dull and 
                  lumpish nature and had no more language than beasts. But 
                  Sauron had made use of them, teaching them what little they 
                  could learn, and increasing their wits with wickedness.<BR>In 
                  the long letter of September 1954 cited in note I he wrote of 
                  them:<BR>I am not sure about Trolls. I think they are mere 
                  'counterfeits', and hence (though here I am of course only 
                  using elements of old barbarous mythmaking that had no 'aware' 
                  metaphysic) they return to mere stone images when not in the 
                  dark. But there are other sorts of Trolls beside these rather 
                  ridiculous, if brutal. Stone-trolls, for which other origins 
                  are suggested. Of course ... when you make Trolls speak you 
                  are giving them a power, which in our world (probably) 
                  connotes the possession of a 'soul'.<BR>Note 4. See p. 138.-At 
                  the bottom of the page bearing the brief text V (p. 389) my 
                  father jotted down the following, entirely unconnected with 
                  the matter of the text:<BR>Living things in Aman. As the Valar 
                  would robe themselves like the Children, many of the Maiar 
                  robed themselves like other lesser living things, as trees, 
                  flowers, beasts. (Huan.)<BR>Note 5. 'There came Gwaihir the 
                  Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of all the 
                  Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descend-ants of old 
                  Thorondor' ('The Field of Cormallen' in The Return of the 
                  King).<BR>Note 6. At this point there is a note that begins 
                  'Criticism of (1) (2) (3) above' (i.e. the opening points of 
                  this text, p. 409) and then refers obscurely to the last 
                  battle and fall of Barad-dыr etc.' in The Lord of the Rings. 
                  In view of what follows my father was presumably thinking of 
                  this passage in the chapter 'Mount Doom':<BR>From all his 
                  policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his 
                  stratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his 
                  realm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, 
                  and his captains suddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered 
                  and despaired. For they were forgotten. <BR>The note 
                  continues:<BR>They had little or no will when not actually 
                  'attended to' by the mind of Sauron. Does their cheating and 
                  rebellion pass that possible to such animals as dogs 
                  etc.?<BR>Note 7. Cf. the end of the passage cited from the 
                  letter of 1954 m note 3.<BR>Note 8. Appendix F (I): 'It is 
                  said that the Black Speech was devised by Sauron in the Dark 
                  Years'.<BR>Note 9. See the citation from the Athrabeth in note 
                  2. Finrod did not in fact assert the latter part of the 
                  opinion here attributed to him.<BR>Note 10. The assertion that 
                  'it remains therefore terribly possible there was an Elvish 
                  strain in the Orcs' seems merely to contradict what has been 
                  said about their being no more than 'talking beasts' without 
                  advancing any new considerations. In the passage added at the 
                  end of the text the statement that 'Orcs are beasts' is 
                  repeated.</FONT></P>

                  <BR><BR>IX<BR>This is another and quite separate note on the 
                  origin of the Orcs, written quickly in pencil, and without any 
                  indication of date.<BR>This suggests - though it is not 
                  explicit - that the 'Orcs' were of Elvish origin. Their origin 
                  is more clearly dealt with elsewhere. One point only is 
                  certain: Melkor could not 'create' living 'creatures' of 
                  independent wills.<BR>He (and all the 'spirits' of the 
                  'First-created', according to their measure) could assume 
                  bodily shapes; and he (and they) could dominate the minds of 
                  other creatures, including Elves and Men, by force, fear, or 
                  deceits, or sheer magnificence.<BR>The Elves from their 
                  earliest times invented and used a word or words with a base 
                  (o)rok to denote anything that caused fear and/or horror. It 
                  would originally have been applied to 'phantoms' (spirits 
                  assuming visible forms) as well as to any independ-ently 
                  existing creatures. Its application (in all Elvish tongues) 
                  specifically to the creatures called Orks - so I shall spell 
                  it in The Silmarillion — was later.<BR>Since Melkor could not 
                  'create' an independent species, but had immense powers of 
                  corruption and distortion of those that came into his power, 
                  it is probable that these Orks had a mixed origin. Most of 
                  them plainly (and biologically) were corruptions of Elves (and 
                  probably later also of Men). But always among them (as special 
                  servants and spies of Melkor, and as leaders) there must have 
                  been numerous corrupted minor spirits who assumed similar 
                  bodily shapes. (These would exhibit terrifying and demonic 
                  characters.)<BR>The Elves would have classed the creatures 
                  called 'trolls' (in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings) as 
                  Orcs - in character and origin - but they were larger and 
                  slower. It would seem evident that they were corruptions of 
                  primitive human types.<BR>At the bottom of the page my father 
                  wrote: 'See The Lord of the Rings Appendix p. 410'; this is 
                  the passage in Appendix F concerning Trolls.<BR>It seems 
                  possible that his opening words in this note 'This suggests 
                  -though it is not explicit - that the "Orcs" were of Elvish 
                  origin' actually refer to the previous text given here, VIII, 
                  where he first wrote that 'Elves, as a source, are very 
                  unlikely', but later concluded that 'it remains therefore 
                  terribly possible there was an Elvish strain in the Orcs'. But 
                  if this is so, the following words 'Their origin is more 
                  clearly dealt with elsewhere' must refer to something 
                  else.<BR>He now expressly asserts the earlier view (see p. 408 
                  and note 1 / Fr.168/) that the Orcs were in origin corrupted 
                  Elves, but observes that later' some were probably derived 
                  from Men. In saying this (as the last paragraph and the 
                  reference to The Lord of the Rings Appendix F suggest) he 
                  seems to have been thinking of Trolls, and specifically of the 
                  Olog-hai, the great Trolls who appeared at the end of the 
                  Third Age (as stated in Appendix F): "That Sauron bred them 
                  none doubted, though from what stock was not known. Some held 
                  that they were not Trolls but giant Orcs; but the Olog-hai 
                  were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike even the largest 
                  of Orc-kind, whom they far sur-passed in size and 
                  power.'<BR>The conception that among the Orcs 'there must have 
                  been numerous corrupted minor spirits who assumed similar 
                  bodily shapes' appears also in text VIII (p. 410): 'Melkor had 
                  corrupted many spirits - some great, as Sauron, or less so, as 
                  Balrogs. The least could have been primitive (and much more 
                  powerful and perilous) Orcs' / Fr.168/.</FONT></P>

                  (HME 10)/5:10. Myths Transformed. /Orcs-III/. /Autocomm./ 
                  <BR><BR>X<BR>I give here a text of an altogether different 
                  kind, a very finished essay on the origin of the Orcs'. It is 
                  necessary to explain something of the relations of this 
                  text.<BR>There is a major work, which I hope to publish in The 
                  History of Middle-earth, entitled Essekenta Eldarinwa or 
                  Quendi and Eldar, It is extant in a good typescript made by my 
                  father on his later typewriter, both in top copy and carbon; 
                  and it is preceded in both copies by a manuscript page which 
                  describes tie content of the work:<BR>Enquiry into the origins 
                  of the Elvish names for Elves and their varieties clans and 
                  divisions: with Appendices on their names for the other 
                  Incarnates: Men, Dwarves, and Orcs; and on their analysis of 
                  their own language, Quenya: with a note on tile 'Language of 
                  the Valar'.<BR>With the appendices Quendi and Eldar runs to 
                  nearly fifty closely typed pages, and being a highly finished 
                  and lucid work is of the utmost interest.<BR>To one of the 
                  title pages my father subjoined the following: <BR>To which is 
                  added an abbreviation of the Уsanwe-kenta or 'Communication of 
                  Thought that Pengolodh set at the end of his Lammas or 
                  'Account of Tongues'<BR>This is a separate work of eight 
                  typescript pages, separately paginated, but found together 
                  with both copies of Quendi and Eldar. In addition, and not 
                  referred to on the title-pages, there is a further typescript 
                  of four pages (also found with both copies of Quendi and 
                  Eldar) entitled Orcs, and this is the text given here.<BR>All 
                  three elements are identical in general appearance, but Orcs 
                  stands apart from the others, having no linguistic bearing; 
                  and in view of this I have thought it legitimate to abstract 
                  it and print it in this book together with the other 
                  discussions of the origin of the Orcs given as texts VIII / 
                  Fr.168/ and IX / Fr.169/.<BR>As to the date of this complex, 
                  one of the copies is preserved in a folded newspaper of March 
                  1960. On this my father wrote: '"Quendi and Eldar" with 
                  Appendices'; beneath is a brief list of the Appendices, the 
                  items all written at the same time, which includes both Уsanwe 
                  and Origin of Orcs (the same is true of the cover of the other 
                  copy of the Quendi and Eldar complex). All the material was 
                  thus in being when the newspaper was used for this purpose, 
                  and although, as in other similar cases, this does not provide 
                  a perfectly certain terminus ad quern, there seems no reason 
                  to doubt that it belongs to 1959-60 (cf. p. 304).<BR>Appendix 
                  C to Quendi and Eldar, 'Elvish Names for the Orcs' / Fr.192/, 
                  is primarily concerned with etymology, but it opens with the 
                  following passage:<BR>It is not here the place to debate the 
                  question of the origin of the Orcs. They were bred by Melkor, 
                  and their breeding was the most wicked and lamentable of his 
                  works in Arda, but not the most terrible. For clearly they 
                  were meant in his malice to be a mockery of the Children of 
                  Iluvatar, wholly subservient to his will, and nursed in an 
                  unappeasable hatred of Elves and Men.<BR>The Orcs of the later 
                  wars, after the escape of Melkor-Morgoth and his return to 
                  Middle-earth, were neither spirits nor phantoms, but living 
                  creatures, capable of speech and of some crafts and 
                  organization, or at least capable of learning such things from 
                  higher creatures or from their Master. They bred and 
                  multiplied rapidly whenever left undisturbed. It is unlikely, 
                  as a consideration of the ultimate origin of this race would 
                  make clearer, that the Quendi had met any Orcs of this kind, 
                  before their finding by Oromл and the separation of Eldar and 
                  Avari.<BR>But it is known that Melkor had become aware of the 
                  Quendi before the Valar began their war against him, and the 
                  joy of the Elves in Middle-earth had already been darkened by 
                  shadows of fear. Dreadful shapes had begun to haunt the 
                  borders of their dwellings, and some of their people vanished 
                  into the darkness and were heard of no more. Some of these 
                  things may have been phantoms and delusions; but some were, no 
                  doubt, shapes taken by the servants of Melkor, mocking and 
                  degrading the very forms of the Children. For Melkor had in 
                  his service great numbers of the Maiar, who had the power, as 
                  had their Master, of taking visible and tangible shape in 
                  Arda.<BR>No doubt my father was led from his words here 'It is 
                  unlikely, as a consideration of the ultimate origin of this 
                  race would make clearer, that the Quendi had met any Orcs of 
                  this kind, before their finding by Oromл' to write that 
                  'consideration' which follows here. It will be seen that one 
                  passage of this initial statement was re-used.<BR>Orcs 
                  /OrcsIIIA/<BR>The origin of the Orcs is a matter of debate. 
                  Some have called them the Melkorohнni, the Children of Melkor; 
                  but the wiser say: nay, the slaves of Melkor, but not his 
                  children; for Melkor had no children. (1) Nonetheless, it was 
                  by the malice of Melkor that the Orcs arose, and plainly they 
                  were meant by him to be a mockery of the Children of Eru, 
                  being bred to be wholly subservient to his will and filled 
                  with unappeasable hatred of Elves and Men.<BR>Now the Orcs of 
                  the later wars, after the escape of Melkor-Morgoth and his 
                  return to Middle-earth, were not 'spirits', nor phantoms, but 
                  living creatures, capable of speech and some crafts and 
                  organization; or at least capable of learning these things 
                  from higher creatures and from their Master. They bred and 
                  multiplied rapidly, whenever left undisturbed. So far as can 
                  be gleaned from the legends that have come down to us from our 
                  earliest days, (2) it would seem that the Quendi had never yet 
                  encountered any Orcs of this kind before the coming of Oromл 
                  to Cuiviйnen.<BR>Those who believe that the Orcs were bred 
                  from some kind of Men, captured and perverted by Melkor, 
                  assert that it was impossible for the Quendi to have known of 
                  Orcs before the Separation and the departure of the Eldar. For 
                  though the time of the awakening of Men is not known, even the 
                  calculations of the loremasters that place it earliest do not 
                  assign it a date long before the Great March began, (3) 
                  certainly not long enough before it to allow for the 
                  corruption of Men into Orcs. On the other hand, it is plain 
                  that soon after his return Morgoth had at his command a great 
                  number of these creatures, with whom he ere long began to 
                  attack the Elves. There was still less time between his return 
                  and these first assaults for the breeding of Orcs and for the 
                  transfer of their hosts westward.<BR>This view of the origin 
                  of the Orcs thus meets with difficulties of chronology. But 
                  though Men may take comfort in this, the theory remains 
                  nonetheless the most probable. It accords with all that is 
                  known of Melkor, and of the nature and behaviour of Orcs - and 
                  of Men. Melkor was impotent to produce any living thing, but 
                  skilled in the corruption of things that did not proceed from 
                  himself, if he could dominate them. But if he had indeed 
                  attempted to make creatures of his own in imitation or mockery 
                  of the Incarnates, he would, like Aulл, only have succeeded in 
                  producing puppets: his creatures would have acted only while 
                  the attention of his will was upon them, and they would have 
                  shown no reluctance to execute any command of his, even if it 
                  were to destroy themselves.<BR>But the Orcs were not of this 
                  kind. They were certainly dominated by their Master, but his 
                  dominion was by fear, and they were aware of this fear and 
                  hated him. They were indeed so corrupted that they were 
                  pitiless, and there was no cruelty or wickedness that they 
                  would not commit; but this was the corruption of independent 
                  wills, and they took pleasure in their deeds. They were 
                  capable of acting on their own, doing evil deeds unbidden for 
                  their own sport; or if Morgoth and his agents were far away, 
                  they might neglect his commands. They sometimes fought [&gt; 
                  They hated one another and often fought] among themselves, to 
                  the detriment of Morgoth's plans.<BR>Moreover, the Orcs 
                  continued to live and breed and to carry on their business of 
                  ravaging and plundering after Morgoth was overthrown. They had 
                  other characteristics of the Incarnates also. They had 
                  languages of their own, and spoke among themselves in various 
                  tongues according to differences of breed that were 
                  discernible among them. They needed food and drink, and rest, 
                  though many were by training as tough as Dwarves in enduring 
                  hardship. They could be slain, and they were subject to 
                  disease; but apart from these ills they died and were not 
                  immortal, even according to the manner of the Quendi; indeed 
                  they appear to have been by nature short-lived compared with 
                  the span of Men of higher race, such as the Edain.<BR>This 
                  last point was not well understood in the Elder Days. For 
                  Morgoth had many servants, the oldest and most potent of whom 
                  were immortal, belonging indeed in their beginning to the 
                  Maiar; and these evil spirits like their Master could take on 
                  visible forms. Those whose business it was to direct the Orcs 
                  often took Orkish shapes, though they were greater and more 
                  terrible. (4) Thus it was that the histories speak of Great 
                  Orcs or Orc-captains who were not slain, and who reappeared in 
                  battle through years far longer than the span of the lives of 
                  Men.* [*footnote to the text: Boldog, for instance, is a name 
                  that occurs many times in the tales of the War. But it is 
                  possible that Boldog was not a personal name, and either a 
                  title, or else the name of a kind of creature: the Orc-formed 
                  Maiar, only less formidable than the Balrogs]. (5)<BR>Finally, 
                  there is a cogent point, though horrible to relate. It became 
                  clear in time that undoubted Men could under the domination of 
                  Morgoth or his agents in a few generations be reduced almost 
                  to the Orc-level of mind and habits; and then they would or 
                  could be made to mate with Orcs, producing new breeds, often 
                  larger and more cunning. There is no doubt that long 
                  afterwards, in the Third Age, Saruman rediscovered this, or 
                  learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed 
                  this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, 
                  producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men 
                  treacherous and vile.<BR>But even before this wickedness of 
                  Morgoth was suspected the Wise in the Elder Days taught always 
                  that the Orcs were not 'made' by Melkor, and therefore were 
                  not in their origin evil. They might have become irredeemable 
                  (at least by Elves and Men), but they remained within the Law. 
                  That is, that though of necessity, being the fingers of the 
                  hand of Morgoth, they must be fought with the utmost severity, 
                  they must not be dealt with in their own terms of cruelty and 
                  treachery. Captives must not be tormented, not even to 
                  discover information for the defence of the homes of Elves and 
                  Men. If any Orcs surrendered and asked for mercy, they must be 
                  granted it, even at a cost.** [**footnote to the text: Few 
                  Orcs ever did so in the Elder Days, and at no time would any 
                  Orc treat with any Elf. For one thing Morgoth had achieved was 
                  to convince the Orcs beyond refutation that the Elves were 
                  crueller than themselves, taking captives only for 
                  'amuse-ment', or to eat them (as the Orcs would do at need)]. 
                  This was the teaching of the Wise, though in the horror of the 
                  War it was not always heeded.<BR>It is true, of course, that 
                  Morgoth held the Orcs in dire thraldom; for in their 
                  corruption they had lost almost all possibility of resisting 
                  the domination of his will. So great indeed did its pressure 
                  upon them become ere Angband fell that, if he turned his 
                  thought towards them, they were conscious of his 'eye' 
                  wherever they might be; and when Morgoth was at last removed 
                  from Arda the Orcs that survived in the West were scattered, 
                  leaderless and almost witless, and were for a long time 
                  without control or purpose.</FONT></P>

                  <P><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size=2>This 
                  servitude to a central will that reduced the Orcs almost to an 
                  ant-like life was seen even more plainly in the Second and 
                  Third Ages under the tyranny of Sauron, Morgoth's chief 
                  lieutenant. Sauron indeed achieved even greater control over 
                  his Orcs than Morgoth had done. He was, of course, operating 
                  on a smaller scale, and he had no enemies so great and so fell 
                  as were the Noldor in their might in the Elder Days. But he 
                  had also inherited from those days difficulties, such as the 
                  diversity of the Orcs in breed and language, and the feuds 
                  among them; while in many places in Middle-earth, after the 
                  fall of Thangorodrim and during the concealment of Sauron, the 
                  Orcs recovering from their helplessness had set up petty 
                  realms of their own and had become accustomed to independence. 
                  Nonetheless Sauron in time managed to unite them all in 
                  unreasoning hatred of the Elves and of Men who associated with 
                  them; while the Orcs of his own trained armies were so 
                  completely under his will that they would sacrifice themselves 
                  without hesitation at his com-mand.*** [***footnote to the 
                  text: But there remained one flaw in his control, inevitable. 
                  In the kingdom of hate and fear, the strongest thing is hate. 
                  All his Orcs hated one another, and must be kept ever at war 
                  with some 'enemy' to prevent them from slaying one another]. 
                  And he proved even more skilful than his Master also in the 
                  corruption of Men who were beyond the reach of the Wise, and 
                  in reducing them to a vassalage, in which they would march 
                  with the Orcs, and vie with them in cruelty and 
                  destruction.<BR>If is thus probably to Sauron that we may look 
                  for a solution of the problem of chronology. Though of 
                  immensely smaller native power than his Master, he remained 
                  less corrupt, cooler and more capable of calculation. At least 
                  in the Elder Days, and before he was bereft of his lord and 
                  fell into the folly of imitating him, and endeavouring to 
                  become himself supreme Lord of Middle-earth. While Morgoth 
                  still stood, Sauron did not seek his own supremacy, but worked 
                  and schemed for another, desiring the triumph of Melkor, whom 
                  in the begin-ning he had adored. He thus was often able to 
                  achieve things, first conceived by Melkor, which his master 
                  did not or could not complete in the furious haste of his 
                  malice.<BR>We may assume, then, that the idea of breeding the 
                  Orcs came from Melkor, not at first maybe so much for the 
                  provision of servants or the infantry of his wars of 
                  destruction, as for the defilement of the Children and the 
                  blasphemous mockery of the designs of Eru. The details of the 
                  accomplishment of this wickedness were, however, left mainly 
                  to the subtleties of Sauron. In that case the conception in 
                  mind of the Orcs may go far back into the night of Melkor's 
                  thought, though the beginning of their actual breeding must 
                  await the awakening of Men.<BR>When Melkor was made captive, 
                  Sauron escaped and lay hid, in Middle-earth; and it can in 
                  this way be understood how the breeding of the Orcs (no doubt 
                  already begun) went on with increasing speed during the age 
                  when the Noldor dwelt in Aman; so that when they returned to 
                  Middle-earth they found it already infested with this plague, 
                  to the torment of all that dwelt there, Elves or Men or 
                  Dwarves. It was Sauron, also, who secretly repaired Angband 
                  for the help of his Master when he returned; (6) and there the 
                  dark places underground were already manned with hosts of the 
                  Orcs before Melkor came back at last, as Morgoth the Black 
                  Enemy, and sent them forth to bring ruin upon all that was 
                  fair. And though Angband has fallen and Morgoth is removed, 
                  still they come forth from the lightless places in the 
                  darkness of their hearts, and the earth is withered under 
                  their pitiless feet.<BR>This then, as it may appear, was my 
                  father's final view of the question: Orcs were bred from Men, 
                  and if 'the conception in mind of the Orcs may go far back 
                  into the night of Melkor's thought' it was Sauron who, during 
                  the ages of Melkor's captivity in Aman, brought into being the 
                  black armies that were available to his Master when he 
                  returned.<BR>But, as always, it is not quite so simple. 
                  Accompanying one copy of the typescript of this essay are some 
                  pages in manuscript for which my father used the blank reverse 
                  sides of papers provided by the publishers dated 10 November 
                  1969. These pages carry two notes on the 'Orcs' essay: one, 
                  discussing the spelling of the word orc, is given on p. 422 / 
                  Fr.170, OrcsIIIB/; the other is a note arising from something 
                  in the essay which is not indicated, but which is obviously 
                  the passage on p. 417 / Fr.170, ORcsIIIA/ discussing the 
                  puppet-like nature inevitable in creatures brought into being 
                  by one of the great Powers themselves: the note was intended 
                  to stand in relation to the words 'But the Orcs were not of 
                  this kind'.<BR>The orks, it is true, sometimes appear to have 
                  been reduced to a condition very similar, though there remains 
                  actually a profound difference. Those orks who dwell long 
                  under the immediate attention of his will - as garrisons of 
                  his strongholds or elements of armies trained for special 
                  purposes in his war-designs — would act like herds, obeying 
                  instantly, as if with one will, his commands even if ordered 
                  to sacrifice their lives in his service. And as was seen when 
                  Morgoth was at last overthrown and cast out, those orks that 
                  had been so absorbed scattered helplessly, without purpose 
                  either to flee or to fight, and soon died or slew 
                  themselves.<BR>Other originally independent creatures, and Men 
                  among them (but neither Elves nor Dwarves), could also be 
                  reduced to a like condition. But 'puppets', with no 
                  independent life or will, would simply cease to move or do 
                  anything at all when the will of their maker was brought to 
                  nothing. In any case the number of orks that were thus 
                  'absorbed' was always only a small part of their total. To 
                  hold them in absolute servitude required a great expense of 
                  will. Morgoth though in origin possessed of vast power was 
                  finite; and it was this expenditure upon the orks, and still 
                  more upon the other far more formidable creatures in his 
                  service, that in the event so dissipated his powers of mind 
                  that Morgoth's overthrow became possible. Thus the greater 
                  part of the orks, though under his orders and the dark shadow 
                  of their fear of him, were only intermittently objects of his 
                  immediate thought and concern, and while that was re-moved 
                  they relapsed into independence and became conscious of their 
                  hatred of him and his tyranny. Then they might neglect his 
                  orders, or engage in /their own achievements.../...<BR>Here 
                  the text breaks off. But the curious thing is that rough 
                  drafting for the second paragraph of this note (written on the 
                  same paper bearing the same date) begins thus:<BR>But Men 
                  could (and can still) be reduced to such a condition. 
                  'Puppets' would simply cease to move or 'live' at all, when 
                  not set in motion by the direct will of their maker. In any 
                  case, though the number of orks at the height of Morgoth's 
                  power, and still after his return from captivity, seems to 
                  have been very great, those who were 'absorbed' were always a 
                  small part of the total.<BR>The words that I have italicised 
                  deny an essential conception of the essay. <BR>The other note 
                  reads thus:<BR>Orcs /Orcs IIIB/<BR>This spelling was taken 
                  from Old English. The word seemed, in itself, very suitable to 
                  the creatures that I had in mind. But the Old English orc in 
                  meaning - so far as that is known - is not suitable. (7) Also 
                  the spelling of what, in the later more organized linguistic 
                  situation, must have been a Common Speech form of a word or 
                  group of similar words should be ork. If only because of 
                  spelling difficulties in modern English: an adjective orc + 
                  ish becomes necessary, and orcish will not do. (8) In any 
                  future publi-cation I shall use ork.<BR>In text IX / Fr.169/ 
                  (the brief writing in which my father declared the theory of 
                  Elvish origin to be certain) he spelt the word Orks, and said 
                  'so I shall spell it in The Silmarillion'. In the present 
                  essay, obviously later than text IX, it is spelt Orcs, but 
                  now, in 1969 or later, he asserted again that it must be 
                  orks.<BR><BR>Note 1. See text VII, p. 406 / Fr.167, iii, end/. 
                  - On one copy of the text my father pencilled against this 
                  sentence the names Eruseni, Melkorseni.<BR>Note 2. Legends 
                  that have come down to us from our earliest days': this 
                  purports then to be an Elvish writing. Sauron is spoken of 
                  subsequently as a being of the past (This servitude to a 
                  central will .. . was seen even more plainly in the Second and 
                  Third Ages under the tyranny of Sauron', p. 419); but in the 
                  last sentence of the essay the Orcs are a plague that still 
                  afflicts the world.<BR>Note 3. The time of the Awakening of 
                  Men is now placed far back; cf. text II (p. 378): 'The March 
                  of the Eldar is through great Rains? Men awake in an isle amid 
                  the floods'; 'The coming of Men will therefore be much further 
                  back'; 'Men must awake while Melkor is still in [Middle-earth] 
                  - because of their Fall. Therefore in some period during the 
                  Great March (see p. 385 note 14). In the chronology of the 
                  Annals of Aman and the Grey Annals the Great March began in 
                  the Year of the Trees 1105 (p. 82), and the foremost companies 
                  of the Eldar came to the shores of the Great Sea in 1125; Men 
                  awoke in Hildуrien in the year of the first rising of the Sun, 
                  which was the Year of the Trees 1500. Thus if the Awakening of 
                  Men is placed even very late in the period of the Great March 
                  of the Eldar it will be set back by more than 3500 Years of 
                  the Sun. See further p. 430 note 5.<BR>Note 4. Cf. text IX, p. 
                  414: 'But always among them [Orcs] (as special servants and 
                  spies of Melkor, and as leaders) there must have been numerous 
                  corrupted minor spirits who assumed similar bodily shapes' / 
                  Fr.169/; also text VIII, p. 410 / Fr.168/.<BR>Note 5. The 
                  footnote at this point, staring that 'Boldog, for instance, is 
                  a name that occurs many times in the tales of the War', and 
                  was perhaps not a personal name, is curious. Boldog appears 
                  several times in the Lay of Leithian as the name of the 
                  Orc-captain who led a raid into Doriath (references in the 
                  Index to The Lays of Beleriand); he reappears in the Quenta 
                  (IV.113), but is not mentioned thereafter. I do not know of 
                  any other reference to an Orc named Boldog,<BR>Note 7. On the 
                  later story that Angband was built by Melkor in the ancient 
                  days and that it was commanded by Sauron see p. 156, §12. 
                  There has been no reference to the repairing of Angband 
                  against Morgoth's return, and cf. the last narrative 
                  development in the Quenta Silmarillion of the story of his 
                  return (p. 295, §14): Morgoth and Ungoliant 'were drawing near 
                  to the ruins of Angband where his great western stronghold had 
                  been.'<BR>Note 7. See p. 124 / Fr.162b/.<BR>Note 8. 'orcish 
                  will not do': because it would be pronounced 'orsish'. The 
                  0rkish language was so spelt in The Lord of the Rings from the 
                  First Edition.</FONT></P>

                  (HME11)/1. The Grey Annals (The Annals of the Beleriand). 
                  /GA1+GA2/<BR>Valian Year 1050. <BR>[§3]. Hither, it is said, 
                  at this time came Melian the Maia from Valinor, when Varda 
                  made the great stars. In this same time the Quendi awoke by 
                  Kuivienen, as is told in the Chronicle of Aman. <BR>Valian 
                  Year 1080 <BR>[§4]. About this time the spies of Melkor 
                  discovered the Quendi and afflicted them. <BR>1085 <BR>[§5]. 
                  In this year Orome found the Quendi, and befriended them. 
                  <BR>/Comm./ to §§ 3-5. The second sentence of the annal 1050 
                  and the annals 1080 and 1085 were added to the manuscript 
                  subsequently. It is curious that there was no mention of the 
                  Awakening of the Elves in GA 1 nor in GA 2 as written; but 
                  among the rough draft pages referred to on p. 4 there is in 
                  fact a substantial passage beginning: 'In this same time the 
                  Quendi awoke by the waters of Kuivienen: of which more is said 
                  in the Chronicles of Aman.' The text that follows in this 
                  draft is very close - much of it indeed virtually identical - 
                  to the long passage interpolated into AAm (§§43-5 / Fr.161/) 
                  on the fear of Orome among the Quendi, the ensnaring of them 
                  by the servants of Melkor, and the breeding of the Orcs from 
                  those captured. There are no differences of substance between 
                  this text and the passage in AAm; and it is obvious that the 
                  latter followed, and was based on, the former, originally 
                  intended for inclusion in the Grey Annals. <BR>In AAm the same 
                  dates are given for the Awakening of the Elves (1050) and for 
                  their discovery by Orome (1085); no date is given in AAm for 
                  their discovery by Melkor, but it is said (AAm §43 / Fr.161/) 
                  that this was 'some years ere the coming of Orome'. 
                  <BR><BR>Fr.172.<BR>WJ (HME11)/1. The Grey Annals (The Annals 
                  of the Beleriand). /GA1+GA2/<BR>Valian Year 1330. /The Period 
                  of Melkor’s Chaining, 1090-1495/ <BR>[§26]. And ere long (in

                  passes in the mountains, or up from the south through the dark 
                  forests. Wolves there were, or creatures that walked in 
                  wolf-shapes, and other fell beings of shadow. <BR>[§27]. Among 
                  these were the Orkor indeed, who after wrought ruin in 
                  Beleriand; but they were yet few and wary and did but smell 
                  out the ways of the land, awaiting the return of their Lord. 
                  Whence they came, or what they were, the Elves knew not then, 
                  deeming them to be Avari, maybe, that had become evil and 
                  savage in the wild. In which they guessed all too near, it is 
                  said. <BR>/Comm. to §27/. This paragraph was an addition to GA 
                  1, though not long after the primary text was made. This is 
                  the later conception, introduced into AAm (see X.123, §127 / 
                  Fr.162a/), according to which the Orcs existed before ever 
                  Orome came upon the Elves, being indeed bred by Morgoth from 
                  captured Elves; the older tradition, that Morgoth brought the 
                  Orcs into being when he returned to Middle-earth from Valinor, 
                  survived unchanged in the final form of the Quenta 
                  Silmarillion (see X.194, §62). See further under /Comm. to/ 
                  §29 below. <BR>[§28]. Therefore Thingol bethought [him] of 
                  arms, which before his folk had not needed, and these at first 
                  the Naugrim smithied for him./.../ A warlike race of old were 
                  all the Naugrim, and they would fight fiercely with whomsoever 
                  aggrieved them: folk of Melkor, or Eldar, or Avari, or wild 
                  beasts, or not seldom with their own kin, Dwarves of other 
                  mansions and lordships. <BR>/Comm. to §29/. - Of the 
                  appearance of Orcs and other evil beings in Eriador and even 
                  in Beleriand long before (some 165 Valian Years) the return of 
                  Melkor to Middle-earth, and of the arming of the Sindar by the 
                  Dwarves, there has been no previous suggestion (see under §27

                  earth grew strong and fell, and their dark lord filled them 
                  with a lust of ruin and death; and they issued from Angband's 
                  gates under the clouds that Morgoth sent forth, and passed 
                  silently into the highlands of the north. Thence on a sudden a 
                  great army came.to Beleriand and assailed King Thingol.

                  of the Beleriand). /GA1+GA2/<BR>[§79]. Indeed we learn now in 
                  Eressea from the Valar, through our /Elvish/ kin that dwell 
                  still in Aman, that after Dagor-nuin-Giliath Melkor was so 
                  long in assailing the Eldar with strength for he himself had 
                  departed from Angband, for the last time. Even as before at 
                  the awakening of the Quendi, his spies were watchful, and 
                  tidings soon came to him of the arising of Men. This seemed to 
                  him so great a matter that secretly under shadow he went forth 
                  into Middle-earth, leaving the command of the War to Sauron 
                  his lieutenant. Of his dealings with Men the Eldar knew naught 
                  at that time, and know little now, for neither the Valar nor 
                  Men have spoken to them clearly of these things. [§80]. But 
                  that some darkness lay upon the hearts of Men (as the shadow 
                  of the kinslaying and the doom of Mandos lay upon the Noldor) 
                  the Eldar perceived clearly even in the fair folk of the 
                  Elf-friends that they first knew. To corrupt or destroy 
                  whatsoever arose new and fair was ever the chief desire of 
                  Morgoth; but as regards the Eldar, doubtless he had this 
                  purpose also in his errand: by fear and lies to make Men their 
                  foes, and bring them up out of the East against Beleriand. But 
                  this design was slow to ripen, and was never wholly achieved, 
                  for Men (it is said) were at first very few in number, whereas 
                  Morgoth grew afraid of the tidings of the growing power and 
                  union of the Eldar and came back to Angband, leaving behind at 
                  that time but few servants, and those of less might and 
                  cunning. <BR>[§87] From them /Dark Elves of the Eastlands = 
                  Avari/ it is said that they took the first beginnings of the 
                  western tongues of Men; and from them also they heard rumour 
                  of the Blessed Realms of the West and of the Powers of Light 
                  that dwelt there. Therefore many of the Fathers of Men, the 
                  Atanatari, in their wanderings moved ever westward, fleeing 
                  from the darkness that had ensnared them. For these 
                  Elf-friends were Men that had repented and rebelled against 
                  the Dark Power, and were cruelly hunted and oppressed by those 
                  that worshipped it, and its servants.<BR>/Comm. to §87/. The 
                  very interesting addition at the end of the annal belongs with 
                  the insertion about Morgoth's departure into the East. There 
                  it is said (§80): 'But that some darkness lay upon the hearts 
                  of Men ... the Eldar perceived clearly even in the fair folk 
                  of the Elf-friends that they first knew'; but the present 
                  passage is the first definite statement that Men in their 
                  beginning fell to the worship of Morgoth, and that the 
                  Elf-friends, repentant, fled west to escape persecution. In 
                  the long account of his works written for Milton Waldman in 
                  1951, and so very probably belonging to the same period, my 
                  father had said: 'The first fall of Man ... nowhere appears - 
                  Men do not come on the stage until all that is long past, and 
                  there is only a rumour that for a while they fell under the 
                  domination of the Enemy and that some repented' (Letters 
                  no.131, pp. 147-8; see X.354 - 5). <BR><BR>Fr.177.<BR>WJ

                  /GA1+GA2/<BR>[§81]. /After the Third Battle, Dagor Aglareb (60 
                  Year of Sun)/. Certain it is that at this time (which was the 
                  time of his return, if the aforesaid account be true, as we 
                  must believe) Morgoth began a new evil, desiring above all to 
                  sow fear and disunion among the Eldar in Beleriand. He now 
                  bade the Orkor to take alive any of the Eldar that they could 
                  and bring them bound to Angband. For it was his intent to use 
                  their lore and skill under duress for his own ends; moreover 
                  he took pleasure in tormenting them, and would besides by pain 
                  wring from them at times tidings of the deeds and counsels of 
                  his enemies. Some indeed he so daunted by the terror of his 
                  eyes that they needed no chains more, but walked ever in fear 
                  of him, doing his will wherever they might be. These he would 
                  unbind and let return to work treason among their own kin. In 
                  this way also was the curse of Mandos fulfilled, for after a 
                  while the Elves grew afraid of those who claimed to have 
                  escaped from thraldom, and often those hapless whom the Orcs 
                  ensnared, even if they broke from the toils would but wander 
                  homeless and friendless thereafter, becoming outlaws in the 
                  woods. <BR><BR>Fr.178.<BR>WJ (HME11)/1. The Grey Annals (The

                  even as Turin came up the ghastly sack of Nargothrond was

                  are found in the early typescript LQ 1, but some are not, and 
                  appear only in LQ 2: these cases are noticed in the account 
                  that follows. /.../ In QS §115 / Fr.105/ the account ran thus: 
                  Of old the lord of Ossiriand was Denethor, friend of Thingol; 
                  but he was slain in battle when he marched to the aid of 
                  Thingol against Melko, in the days when the Orcs were first 
                  made and broke the starlit peace of Beleriand. Thereafter 
                  Doriath was fenced with enchantment’ /.../. It is notable that 
                  the phrase 'in the days when the Orcs were first made' was 
                  never altered. <BR><BR>Fr.183.<BR>WJ (HME11)/2:15. The Later

                  and the Fall of Fingolfin. <BR>[§143]. Sauron was the chief 
                  servant of the evil Vala, whom he had suborned to his service 
                  in Valinor from among the people of the gods. He was become a 
                  wizard of dreadful power, master of necromancy, foul in 
                  wisdom' &gt; 'Now Sauron, whom the Noldor call Gorthu, was the 
                  chief servant of Morgoth. In Valinor he had dwelt among the 
                  people of the gods, but there Morgoth had drawn him to evil 
                  and to his service. He was become now a sorcerer of dreadful 
                  power, master of shadows and of ghosts, foul in wisdom'. On 
                  this passage, and the name Gorthu, see V.333, 338, and the 
                  commentary on QS §143 (V.290). In the footnote to this

                  they said. 'We shall soon find what way things go,' said 
                  Asgon. 'Orcs are little worse than Eastrons, I guess. If

                  to the Elves and their varieties in Quenya, Telerin, and 
                  Sindarin.<BR>Quenya. <BR>1. quen, pl. queni, person, 
                  individual, man or woman. Chiefly used in the unstressed form 
                  quen. Mostly found in the singular: 'one, somebody'; in the 
                  pl. 'people, they'. Also combined with other elements, as in 
                  aiquen 'if anybody, whoever', ilquen 'everybody'. In a number 
                  of old compounds -quen, pl. queni was combined with noun or 
                  adjective stems to denote habitual occupations or functions, 
                  or to describe those having some notable (permanent) quality: 
                  as -man in English (but without distinction of sex) in 
                  horseman, seaman, work- man, nobleman, etc. Q roquen 
                  'horseman, rider'; (Note 3, p. 407) kiryaquen 'shipman, 
                  sailor'; arquen 'a noble'. These words belong to everyday 
                  speech, and have no special reference to Elves. They were 
                  freely applied to other Incarnates, such as Men or Dwarves, 
                  when the Eldar became acquainted with them. <BR>2. Quendi 
                  Elves, of any kind, including the Avari. The sg. Quende was 
                  naturally less frequently used. As has been seen, the word was 
                  made when the Elves as yet knew of no other 'people' than 
                  themselves. The sense 'the Elvish people, as a whole', or in 
                  the sg. 'an Elf and not some other similar creature', 
                  developed first in Aman, where the Elves lived among or in 
                  contact with the Valar and Maiar. During the Exile when the 
                  Noldor became re-associated with their Elvish kin, the Sindar, 
                  but met other non-Elvish people, such as Orcs, Dwarves, and 
                  Men, it became an even more useful term. But in fact it had 
                  ceased in Aman to be a word of everyday use, and remained 
                  thereafter mainly used in the special language of Lore: 
                  histories or tales of old days, or learned writings on peoples 
                  and languages. In ordinary language the Elves of Aman called 
                  themselves Eldar (or in Telerin Elloi): see below. There also 
                  existed two old compounds containing *kwendi: *kala-kwendi and 
                  *mori-kwendi, the Light-folk and the Dark-folk. These terms 
                  appear to go back to the period before the Separation, or 
                  rather to the time of the debate among the Quendi concerning 
                  the invitation of the Valar. They were evidently made by the 
                  party favourable to Orome, and referred originally to those 
                  who desired the Light of Valinor (where the ambassadors of the 
                  Elves reported that there was no darkness), and those who did 
                  not wish for a place in which there was no night. But already 
                  before the final separation *mori-kwendi may have referred to 
                  the glooms and the clouds dimming the sun and the stars during 
                  the War of the Valar and Melkor,(6) so that the term from the 
                  beginning had a tinge of scorn, implying that such folk were 
                  not averse to the shadows of Melkor upon Middle-earth. <BR>The 
                  lineal descendants of these terms survived only in the 
                  languages of Aman. The Quenya forms were Kalaquendi and 
                  Moriquendi. The Kalaquendi in Quenya applied only to the Elves 
                  who actually lived or had lived in Aman; and the Moriquendi 
                  was applied to all others, whether they had come on the March 
                  or not. The latter were regarded as greatly inferior to the 
                  Kalaquendi, who had experienced the Light of Valinor, and had 
                  also acquired far greater knowledge and powers by their 
                  association with the Valar and Maiar. In the period of Exile 
                  the Noldor modified their use of these terms, which was 
                  offensive to the Sindar. Kalaquendi went out of use, except in 
                  written Noldorin lore. Moriquendi was now applied to all other 
                  Elves, except the Noldor and Sindar, that is to Avari or to 
                  any kind of Elves that at the time of the coming of the Noldor 
                  had not long dwelt in Beleriand and were not subjects of Elwe. 
                  It was never applied, however, to any but Elvish peoples. The 
                  old distinction, when made, was represented by the new terms 
                  Amanyar 'those of Aman', and Uamanyar or Umanyar 'those not of 
                  Aman', beside the longer forms Amaneldi and Umaneldi. <BR>3. 
                  Quendya, in the Noldorin dialect Quenya. This word remained in 
                  ordinary use, but it was only used as a noun 'the Quendian 
                  language'. (Note 4, p. 407) This use of Quendya must have 
                  arisen in Aman, while Quendi still remained in general use. 
                  Historically, and in the more accurate use of the linguistic 
                  Loremasters, Quenya included the dialect of the Teleri, which 
                  though divergent (in some points from days before settlement 
                  in Aman, such as *kw &gt; p), remained generally intelligible 
                  to the Vanyar and Noldor. But in ordinary use it was applied 
                  only to the dialects of the Vanyar and Noldor, the differences 
                  between which only appeared later, and remained, up to the 
                  period just before the Exile, of minor importance. In the use 
                  of the Exiles Quenya naturally came to mean the language of 
                  the Noldor, developed in Aman, as distinct from other tongues, 
                  whether Elvish or not. But the Noldor did not forget its 
                  connexion with the old word Quendi, and still regarded the 
                  name as implying 'Elvish', that is the chief Elvish tongue, 
                  the noblest, and the one most nearly preserving the ancient 
                  character of Elvish speech. For a note on the Elvish words for 
                  'language', especially among the Noldorin Loremasters, see 
                  Appendix D (p. 391). <BR>4. Elda and Eldo. The original 
                  distinction between these forms as meaning 'one of the 
                  Star-folk, or Elves in general', and one of the 'Marchers', 
                  became obscured by the close approach of the forms. The form 
                  Eldo went out of use, and Elda remained the chief word for 
                  'Elf' in Quenya. But it was not in accurate use held to 
                  include the Avari (when they were remembered or considered); 
                  i.e. it took on the sense of Eldo. It may, however, have been 
                  partly due to its older sense that in popular use it was the 
                  word ordinarily employed for any Elf, that is, as an 
                  equivalent of the Quende of the Loremasters. When one of the 
                  Elves of Aman spoke of the Eldalie, 'the Elven-folk', he meant 
                  vaguely all the race of Elves, though he was probably not 
                  thinking of the Avari. <BR>For, of course, the special kinship 
                  of the Amanyar with those left in Beleriand (or Hekeldamar) 
                  was remembered, especially by the Teleri. When it was 
                  necessary to distinguish these two branches of the Eldar (or 
                  properly Eldor), those who had come to Aman were called the 
                  Odzeldi N Oareldi, for which another form (less used) was 
                  Auzeldi, N Aureldi; those who had remained behind were the 
                  Hekeldi. These terms naturally belonged rather to history than 
                  everyday speech, and in the period of the Exile they fell out 
                  of use, being unsuitable to the situation in Beleriand. The 
                  Exiles still claimed to be Amanyar, but in practice this term 
                  usually now meant those Elves remaining in Aman, while the 
                  Exiles called themselves Etyangoldi 'Exiled Noldor', or simply 
                  (since the great majority of their clan had come into exile) 
                  Noldor. All the subjects of Elwe they called Sindar or 
                  'Grey-elves'.</FONT></P>

                  The derivatives of *KWEN were more sparingly represented in 
                  the Telerin dialects, of Aman or Beleriand. This was in part 
                  due to the Common Telerin change of kw &gt; p, (Note 5, p. 
                  407) which caused *pen &lt; *kwen to clash with the PQ stem 
                  *PEN 'lack, be without', and also with some of the derivatives 
                  of *PED 'slope, slant down' (e.g. *penda 'sloping'). Also the 
                  Teleri felt themselves to be a separate people, as compared 
                  with the Vanyar and Noldor, whom taken together they 
                  outnumbered. This sentiment began before the Separation, and 
                  increased on the March and in Beleriand. In consequence they 
                  did not feel strongly the need for a general word embracing 
                  all Elves, until they came in contact with other non-Elvish 
                  Incarnates. As a pronoun enclitic (e.g. in aipen, Q aiquen; 
                  ilpen, Q ilquen) *kwen survived in Telerin; but few of the 
                  compounds with pen 'man' remained in ordinary use, except 
                  arpen 'noble (man)', and the derived adjective arpenia. Pendi, 
                  the dialectal equivalent of Q Quendi, survived only as a 
                  learned word of the historians, used with reference to ancient 
                  days before the Separation; the adjective *Pendia (the 
                  equivalent of Quendya) had fallen out of use.. (Note 6, p. 
                  408) The Teleri had little interest in linguistic lore, which 
                  they left to the Noldor. They did not regard their language as 
                  a 'dialect' of Quenya, but called it Lindarin or Lindalambe. 
                  Quenya they called Goldorin or Goldolambe; for they had few 
                  contacts with the Vanyar. <BR>The old compounds in Telerin 
                  form Calapendi and Moripendi survived in historical use; but 
                  since the Teleri in Aman remained more conscious of their 
                  kinship with the Elves left in Beleriand, while Calapendi was 
                  used, as Kalaquendi in Quenya, to refer only to the Elves of 
                  Aman, Moripendi was not applied to the Elves of Telerin origin 
                  who had not reached Aman. <BR>2. Ello and Ella. The history of 
                  the meanings of these words was almost identical with that of 
                  the corresponding Elda and Eldo in Quenya. In Telerin the -o 
                  form became preferred, so that generally T Ello was the 
                  equivalent of Q Elda. But Ella remained in use in 
                  quasi-adjectival function (e.g. as the first element in loose 
                  or genitival compounds): thus the equivalent of Q Eldalie was 
                  in T Ellalie. <BR>In contrast to the Elloi left in Beleriand 
                  those in Aman were in histories called Audel, pl. Audelli. 
                  Those in Beleriand were the Hecelloi of Heculbar (or 
                  Hecellubar). <BR>Sindarin. 1. Derivatives of *KWEN were 
                  limited to the sense: pronominal 'one, somebody, anybody', and 
                  to a few old compounds that survived. PQ *kwende, *kwendi 
                  disappeared altogether. The reasons for this were partly the 
                  linguistic changes already cited; and partly the circumstances 
                  in which the Sindar lived, until the return of the Noldor, and 
                  the coming of Men. The linguistic changes made the words 
                  unsuitable for survival; the circumstances removed all 
                  practical need for the term. The old unity of the Elves had 
                  been broken at the Separation. The Elves of Beleriand were 
                  isolated, without contact with any other people, Elvish or of 
                  other kind; and they were all of one clan and language: 
                  Telerin (or Lindarin). Their own language was the only one 
                  that they ever heard; and they needed no word to distinguish 
                  it, nor to distinguish themselves. <BR>As a pronoun, usually 
                  enclitic, the form pen, mutated ben, survived. A few compounds 
                  survived, such as rochben 'rider' (m. or f.), orodben 'a 
                  mountaineer' or 'one living in the mountains', arphen 'a 
                  noble'. Their plurals were made by i-affection, originally 
                  carried through the word: as roechbin, oerydbin, erphin, but 
                  the normal form of the first element was often restored when 
                  the nature of the composition remained evident: as rochbin, 
                  but always erphin. These words had no special association with 
                  Elves. <BR>Associated with these compounds were the two old 
                  words Calben (Celbin) and Morben (Moerbin). On the formal 
                  relation of these to Quenya Kalaquendi and Moriquendi see p. 
                  362. They had no reference to Elves, except by accident of 
                  circumstance. Celbin retained what was, as has been said, 
                  probably its original meaning: all Elves other than the Avari; 
                  and it included the Sindar. It was in fact the equivalent 
                  (when one was needed) of the Quenya Eldar, Telerin Elloi. But 
                  it referred to Elves only because no other people qualified 
                  for the title. Moerbin was similarly an equivalent for Avari; 
                  but that it did not mean only 'Dark-elves' is seen by its 
                  ready application to other Incarnates, when they later became 
                  known. By the Sindar anyone dwelling outside Beleriand, or 
                  entering their realm from outside, was called a Morben. The 
                  first people of this kind to be met were the Nandor, who 
                  entered East Beleriand over the passes of the Mountains before 
                  the return of Morgoth; soon after his return came the first 
                  invasions of his Orcs from the North.(7) Somewhat later the 
                  Sindar became aware of Avari, who had crept in small and 
                  secret groups into Beleriand from the South. Later came the 
                  Men of the Three Houses, who were friendly; and later still 
                  Men of other kinds. All these were at first acquaintance 
                  called Moerbin. (Note 7, p. 408) But when the Nandor were 
                  recog nized as kinsfolk of Lindarin origin and speech (as was 
                  still recognizable), they were received into the class of 
                  Celbin. The Men of the Three Houses were also soon removed 
                  from the class of Moerbin. (Note 8, p. 408) They were given 
                  their own name, Edain, and were seldom actually called Celbin, 
                  but they were recognized as belonging to this class, which 
                  became . practically equivalent to 'peoples in alliance in the 
                  War against Morgoth'. The Avari thus remained the chief 
                  examples of Moerbin. Any individual Avar who joined with or 
                  was admitted among the Sindar (it rarely happened) became a 
                  Calben; but the Avari in general remained secretive, hostile 
                  to the Eldar, and untrustworthy; and they dwelt in hidden 
                  places in the deeper woods, or in caves. (Note 9, p. 408) 
                  Moerbin as applied to them is usually translated 'Dark-elves', 
                  partly because Moriquendi in the Quenya of the Exiled Noldor 
                  usually referred to them. But that no special reference to 
                  Elves was intended by the Sindarin word is shown by the fact 
                  that Moerbin was at once applied to the new bands of Men 
                  (Easterlings) that appeared before the Battle of the Nirnaeth. 
                  (Note 9, p. 408) If in Sindarin an Avar, as distinct from 
                  other kinds of Morben, was intended, he was called Mornedhel. 
                  <BR>2. Edhel, pl. Edhil. In spite of its ultimate derivation 
                  (see p. 360) this was the general word for 'Elf, Elves'. In 
                  the earlier days it naturally referred only to the Eldarin 
                  Sindar, for no other kind was ever seen; but later it was 
                  freely applied to Elves of any kind that entered Beleriand. It 
                  was however only used in these two forms. <BR>The masculine 
                  and feminine forms were Ellon m. and Elleth f. and the 
                  class-plural was Eldrim, later Elrim, when this was not 
                  replaced by the more commonly used Eledhrim (see below). The 
                  form without the m. and f. suffixes was not in use, and 
                  survived only in some old compounds, especially personal 
                  names, in the form el, pl. il, as a final element. The form 
                  Elen, pl. Elin was only used in histories or the works of the 
                  Loremasters, as a word to include all Elves (Eldar and Avari). 
                  But the class-plural Eledhrim was the usual word for 'all the 
                  Elvish race', whenever such an expression was needed. <BR>All 
                  these words and forms, whatever their etymologies (see above), 
                  were applicable to any kind of Elf. In fact Edhel was properly 
                  applied only to Eldar; Ell- may have a mixed origin; and Elen 
                  was an ancient general word. (Note 10, p. 410) <BR>3. The 
                  Sindar had no general name for themselves as distinct from 
                  other varieties of Elf, until other kinds entered Beleriand. 
                  The descendant of the old clan name *Lindai (Q Lindar) had 
                  fallen out of normal use, being no longer needed in a 
                  situation were all the Edhil were of the same kind, and people 
                  were more aware of the growing differences in speech and other 
                  matters between those sections of the Elves that lived in 
                  widely sundered parts of a large and mostly pathless land. 
                  They were thus in ordinary speech all Edhil, but some belonged 
                  to one region and some to another: they were Falathrim from 
                  the sea-board of West Beleriand, or lathrim from Doriath (the 
                  land of the Fence, or iath), or Mithrim who had gone north 
                  from Beleriand and inhabited the regions about the great lake 
                  that afterwards bore their name. (Note 11, p. 410) <BR>The old 
                  clan-name *Lindai survived in the compound Glinnel, pl. 
                  Glinnil, a word only known in historical lore, and the 
                  equivalent of Quenya Teleri or Lindar; see the Notes on the 
                  Clan-names below. All the Sindarin subjects of King 
                  Elu-Thingol, as distinguished from the incoming Noldor, were 
                  sometimes later called the Eluwaith. Dunedhil 'West-elves' 
                  (the reference being to the West of Middle-earth) was a term 
                  made to match Dunedain 'West-men' (applied only to the Men of 
                  the Three Houses). But with the growing amalgamation, outside 
                  Doriath, of the Noldor and Sindar into one people using the 
                  Sindarin tongue as their daily speech, this soon became 
                  applied to both Noldor and Sindar. While the Noldor were still 
                  distinct, and whenever it was desired to recall their 
                  difference of origin, they were usually called Odhil (sg. 
                  Odhel). This as has been seen was originally a name for all 
                  the Elves that left Beleriand for Aman. These were also called 
                  by the Sindar Gwanwen, pl. Gwenwin (or Gwanwel, Gwenwil) 'the 
                  departed': cf. Q vanwa. This term, which could not suitably be 
                  applied to those who had come back, remained the usual 
                  Sindarin name for the Elves that remained in Aman. Odhil thus 
                  became specially the name of the Exiled Noldor. In this sense 
                  the form Godhel, pl. Godhil soon replaced the older form. It 
                  seems to have been due to the influence of the clan-name 
                  Golodh, pl. Goelydh; or rather to a deliberate blending of the 
                  two words. The old clan-name had not fallen out of memory (for 
                  the Noldor and the Sindar owing to the great friendship of 
                  Finwe and Elwe were closely associated during their sojourn in 
                  Beleriand before the Departure) and it had in consequence a 
                  genuine Sindarin form (&lt; CE *ngolodo). But the form Golodh 
                  seems to have been phonetically unpleas- ing to the Noldor. 
                  The name was, moreover, chiefly used by those who wished to 
                  mark the difference between the Noldor and the Sindar, and to 
                  ignore the dwelling of the Noldor in Aman which might give 
                  them a claim to superiority. This was especially the case in 
                  Doriath, where King Thingol was hostile to the Noldorin 
                  chieftains, Feanor and his sons, and Fingolfin, because of 
                  their assault upon the Teleri in Aman, the people of his 
                  brother Olwe. The Noldor, therefore, when using Sindarin, 
                  never applied this name (Golodh) to themselves, and it fell 
                  out of use among those friendly to them. <BR>4. Eglan, pl. 
                  Eglain, Egladrim. This name, 'the Forsaken', was, as has been 
                  said, given by the Sindar to themselves. But it was not in 
                  Beleriand a name for all the Elves who remained there, as were 
                  the related names, Hekeldi, Hecelloi, in Aman. It applied only 
                  to those who wished to depart, and waited long in vain for the 
                  return of Ulmo, taking up their abode on or near the coasts. 
                  There they became skilled in the building and management of 
                  ships. Cirdan was their lord. <BR>Cirdan's folk were made up 
                  both of numbers of the following of Olwe, who straying or 
                  lingering came to the shores too late, and also of many of the 
                  following of Elwe, who abandoned the search for him and did 
                  not wish to be separated for ever from their kin and friends. 
                  This folk remained in the desire of Aman for long years, and 
                  they were among the most friendly to the Exiles.</FONT></P>

                  continued to call themselves the Eglain, and the regions where 
                  they dwelt Eglamar and Eglador. The latter name fell out of 
                  general use. It had originally been applied to all western 
                  Beleriand between Mount Taras and the Bay of Balar, its 
                  eastern boundary being roughly along the River Narog. Eglamar, 
                  however, remained the name of the 'Home of the Eglain': the 
                  sea-board from Cape Andras to the headland of Bar-in-Myl 
                  ('Home of the Gulls'),(8) which included the ship-havens of 
                  Cirdan at Brithonbar (9) and at the head of the firth of 
                  Eglarest. <BR>The Eglain became a people somewhat apart from 
                  the inland Elves, and at the time of the coming of the Exiles 
                  their language was in many ways different. (Note 12, p. 411) 
                  But they acknowledged the high-kingship of Thingol, and Cirdan 
                  never took the title of king.(10) <BR>*Abari. <BR>This name, 
                  evidently made by the Eldar at the time of the Separation, is 
                  found in histories in the Quenya form Avari, and the Telerin 
                  form Abari. It was still used by the historians of the Exiled 
                  Noldor, though it hardly differed from Moriquendi, which (see 
                  above) was no longer used by the Exiles to include Elves of 
                  Eldarin origin. The plural Evair was known to Sindarin 
                  loremasters, but was no longer in use. Such Avari as came into 
                  Beleriand were, as has been said, called Morben, or Mornedhel. 
                  <BR>Author’s Note 7. <BR>The Dwarves were in a special 
                  position. They claimed to have known Beleriand before even the 
                  Eldar first came there; and there do appear to have been small 
                  groups dwelling furtively in the highlands west of Sirion from 
                  a very early date: they attacked and waylaid the Elves by 
                  stealth, and the Elves did not at first recognize them as 
                  Incarnates, but thought them to be some kind of cunning 
                  animal, and hunted them. By their own account they were 
                  fugitives, driven into the wilderness by their own kin further 
                  east, and later they were called the Noegyth Nibin (32) or 
                  Petty-dwarves, for they had become smaller than the norm of 
                  their kind, and filled with hate for all other 
                  creatures.<BR>When the Elves met the powerful Dwarves of 
                  Nogrod and Belegost, in the eastern side of the Mountains, 
                  they recognized them as Incarnates, for they had skill in many 
                  crafts, and learned the Elvish speech readily for purposes of 
                  traffic. At first the Elves were in doubt concerning them, 
                  believing them to be related to Orcs and creatures of Morgoth; 
                  but when they found that, though proud and unfriendly, they 
                  could be trusted to keep any treaties that they made, and did 
                  not molest those who left them in peace, they traded with them 
                  and let them come and go as they would.

                  Appendix A. Elvish names for Men.<BR>The first Elves that Men 
                  met in the world were Avari, some of whom were friendly to 
                  them, but the most avoided them or were hostile (according to 
                  the tales of Men). What names Men and Elves gave to one 
                  another in those remote days, of which little was remembered 
                  when the Loremasters in Beleriand made the acquaintance of the 
                  After-born, there is now no record. By the Dunedain the Elves 
                  were called Nimir (the Beautiful).(18) The Eldar did not meet 
                  Men of any kind or race until the Noldor had long returned to 
                  Beleriand and were at war with Morgoth. The Sindar did not 
                  even know of their existence, until the coming of the Nandor; 
                  and these brought only rumour of a strange people (whom they 
                  had not themselves seen) wandering in the lands of the East 
                  beyond the Hithaeglir. From these uncertain tales the Sindar 
                  concluded that the 'strange people' were either some 
                  diminished race of the Avari, or else related to Orcs, 
                  creatures of Melkor, bred in mockery of the true Quendi. But 
                  the Noldor had already heard of Men in Aman. Their knowledge 
                  came in the first place from Melkor and was perverted by his 
                  malice, but before the Exile those who would listen had 
                  learned more of the truth from the Valar, and they knew that 
                  the newcomers were akin to themselves, being also Children of 
                  Iluvatar, though differing in gifts and fate. Therefore the 
                  Noldor made names for the Second Race of the Children, calling 
                  them the Atani 'the Second Folk'. /.../. <BR><BR>Fr.191.<BR>WJ 
                  (HME11)/3:4. Quendi and Eldar. Appendix B. Elvish names for 
                  the Dvarwes. <BR>The Sindar had long known the Dwarves, and 
                  had entered into peaceful relations with them, though of trade 
                  and exchange of skills rather than of true friendship, before 
                  the coming of the Exiles. The name (in the plural) that the 
                  Dwarves gave to themselves was Khazad, and this the Sindar 
                  rendered as they might in the terms of their own speech, 
                  giving it the form *chadod &gt; *chadaud &gt; Hadhod. (Note 
                  22, p. 412) Hadhod, Hadhodrim was the name which they 
                  continued to use in actual intercourse with the Dwarves; but 
                  among themselves they referred to the Dwarves usually as the 
                  Naugrim 'the Stunted Folk'. The adjective naug 'dwarf(ed), 
                  stunted', however, was not used by itself for one of the 
                  Khazad. The word used was Nogoth, pl. Noegyth, class-plural 
                  Nogothrim (as an occasional equivalent of Naugrim). (Note 23, 
                  p. 413) They also often referred to the Dwarves as a race by 
                  the name Dornhoth 'the Thrawn Folk', because of their stubborn 
                  mood as well as bodily toughness. <BR>The Exiles heard of the 
                  Dwarves first from the Sindar, and when using the Sindarin 
                  tongue naturally adopted the already established names. But 
                  later in Eastern Beleriand the Noldor came into independent 
                  relations with the Dwarves of Eryd Lindon, and they adapted 
                  the name Khazad anew for use in Quenya, giving it the form 
                  Kasar, pl. Kasari or Kasari. (Note 24, p. 413) This was the 
                  word most commonly used in Quenya for the Dwarves, the 
                  partitive plural being Kasalli, and the race-name Kasallie. 
                  But the Sindarin names were also adapted or imitated, a Dwarf 
                  being called Nauko or Norno (the whole people Naukalie or 
                  Nornalie). Norno was the more friendly term. (Note 25, p. 413) 
                  <BR>The Petty-dwarves. See also Note 7 / Fr.89, the end/. The 
                  Eldar did not at first recognize these as Incarnates, for they 
                  seldom caught sight of them in clear light. They only became 
                  aware of their existence indeed when they attacked the Eldar 
                  by stealth at night, or if they caught them alone in wild 
                  places. The Eldar therefore thought that they were a kind of 
                  cunning two-legged animals living in caves, and they called 
                  them Levain tad-dail, or simply Tad-dail, and they hunted 
                  them. But after the Eldar had made the acquaintance of the 
                  Naugrim, the Tad-dail were recognized as a variety of Dwarves 
                  and were left alone. There were then few of them surviving, 
                  and they were very wary, and too fearful to attack any Elf, 
                  unless their hiding-places were approached too nearly. The 
                  Sindar gave them the names Nogotheg 'Dwarf- let', or Nogoth 
                  niben 'Petty Dwarf'.(20) <BR>The great Dwarves despised the 
                  Petty-dwarves, who were (it is said) the descendants of 
                  Dwarves who had left or been driven our from the Communities, 
                  being deformed or undersized, or slothful and rebellious. But 
                  they still acknowledged their kinship and resented any 
                  injuries done to them. Indeed it was one of their grievances 
                  against the Eldar that they had hunted and slain their lesser 
                  kin, who had settled in Beleriand before the Elves came there. 
                  This grievance was set aside, when treaties were made between 
                  the Dwarves and the Sindar, in consideration of the plea that 
                  the Petty-dwarves had never declared themselves to the Eldar, 
                  nor presented any claims to land or habitations, but had at 
                  once attacked the newcomers in darkness and ambush. But the 
                  grievance still smouldered, as was later seen in the case of 
                  Mim, the only Petty-dwarf who played a memorable part in the 
                  Annals of Beleriand. <BR>The Noldor, for use in Quenya, 
                  translated these Sindarin names for the Petty-dwarves by 
                  Attalyar 'Bipeds', and Pikinau- kor or Pitya-naukor.

                  (HME11)/3:4. Quendi and Eldar. Appendix C. Elvish names for 
                  the Orcs.<BR>The opening paragraphs of this Appendix have been 
                  given in Morgoth's Ring p. 416 and are not repeated here / 
                  Fr.170: here I restore it for the reader’s convinience:<BR>It 
                  is not here the place to debate the question of the origin of 
                  the Orcs. They were bred by Melkor, and their breeding was the 
                  most wicked and lamentable of his works in Arda, but not the 
                  most terrible. For clearly they were meant in his malice to be 
                  a mockery of the Children of Iluvatar, wholly subservient to 
                  his will, and nursed in an unappeasable hatred of Elves and 
                  Men.<BR>The Orcs of the later wars, after the escape of 
                  Melkor-Morgoth and his return to Middle-earth, were neither 
                  spirits nor phantoms, but living creatures, capable of speech 
                  and of some crafts and organization, or at least capable of 
                  learning such things from higher creatures or from their 
                  Master. They bred and multiplied rapidly whenever left 
                  undisturbed. It is unlikely, as a consideration of the 
                  ultimate origin of this race would make clearer, that the 
                  Quendi had met any Orcs of this kind, before their finding by 
                  Oromл and the separation of Eldar and Avari.<BR>But it is 
                  known that Melkor had become aware of the Quendi before the 
                  Valar began their war against him, and the joy of the Elves in 
                  Middle-earth had already been darkened by shadows of fear. 
                  Dreadful shapes had begun to haunt the borders of their 
                  dwellings, and some of their people vanished into the darkness 
                  and were heard of no more. Some of these things may have been 
                  phantoms and delusions; but some were, no doubt, shapes taken 
                  by the servants of Melkor, mocking and degrading the very 
                  forms of the Children. For Melkor had in his service great 
                  numbers of the Maiar, who had the power, as had their Master, 
                  of taking visible and tangible shape in Arda. - End of the 
                  restored passage/.<BR>The words that now follow, 'these shapes 
                  and the terror that they inspired', refer to the 'dreadful 
                  shapes' that haunted the dwellings of the Elves in the land of 
                  their awakening. <BR>For these shapes and the terror that they 
                  inspired the element chiefly used in the ancient tongue of the 
                  Elves appears to have been *RUKU. In all the Eldarin tongues 
                  (and, it is said, in the Avarin also) there are many 
                  derivatives of this stem, having such ancient forms as: ruk-, 
                  rauk-, uruk-, urk(u), runk-, rukut/s, besides the strengthened 
                  stem gruk-, and the elaborated guruk-, nguruk. (Note 27, p. 
                  415) Already in PQ that word must have been formed which had 
                  in CE the form *rauku or *rauko. This was applied to the 
                  larger and more terrible of the enemy shapes. But ancient were 
                  also the forms uruk, urku/o, and the adjectival urka 
                  'horrible'. (Note 28, p. 415) In Quenya we meet the noun urko, 
                  pl. urqui, deriving as the plural form shows from *urku or 
                  *uruku. In Sindarin is found the corresponding urug; but there 
                  is in frequent use the form orch, which must be derived from 
                  *urko or the adjectival *urka. <BR>In the lore of the Blessed 
                  Realm the Q urko naturally seldom occurs, except in tales of 
                  the ancient days and the March, and then is vague in meaning, 
                  referring to anything that caused fear to the Elves, any 
                  dubious shape or shadow, or prowling creature. In Sindarin 
                  urug has a similar use. It might indeed be translated 'bogey'. 
                  But the form orch seems at once to have been applied to the 
                  Orcs, as soon as they appeared; and Orch, pl. Yrch, 
                  class-plural Orchoth remained the regular name for these 
                  creatures in Sindarin afterwards. The kinship, though not 
                  precise equivalence, of S orch to Q urko, urqui was 
                  recognized, and in Exilic Quenya urko was commonly used to 
                  translate S orch, though a form showing the influence of 
                  Sindarin, orko, pl. orkor and orqui, is also often found. 
                  <BR>These names, derived by various routes from the Elvish 
                  tongues, from Quenya, Sindarin, Nandorin, and no doubt Avarin 
                  dialects, went far and wide, and seem to have been the source 
                  of the names for the Orcs in most of the languages of the 
                  Elder Days and the early ages of which there is any record. 
                  The form in Adunaic urku, urkhu may be direct from Quenya or 
                  Sindarin; and this form underlies the words for Orc in the 
                  languages of Men of the North-West in the Second and Third 
                  Ages. The Orcs themselves adopted it, for the fact that it 
                  referred to terror and detestation delighted them. The word 
                  uruk that occurs in the Black Speech, devised (it is said) by 
                  Sauron to serve as a lingua franca for his subjects, was 
                  probably borrowed by him from the Elvish tongues of earlier 
                  times. It referred, however, specially to the trained and 
                  disciplined Orcs of the regiments of Mordor. Lesser breeds 
                  seem to have been called snaga.(22) <BR>The Dwarves claimed to 
                  have met and fought the Orcs long before the Eldar in 
                  Beleriand were aware of them. It was indeed their obvious 
                  detestation of the Orcs, and their willingness to assist in 
                  any war against them, that convinced the Eldar that the 
                  Dwarves were no creatures of Morgoth. Nonetheless the Dwarvish 
                  name for Orcs, Rukhs, pl. Rakhas, seems to show affinity to 
                  the Elvish names, and was possibly ultimately derived from 
                  Avarin. <BR>The Eldar had many other names for the Orcs, but 
                  most of these were 'kennings', descriptive terms of occasional 
                  use. One was, however, in frequent use in Sindarin: more often 
                  than Orchoth the general name for Orcs as a race that appears 
                  in the Annals was Glamhoth. Glam meant 'din, uproar, the 
                  confused yelling and bellowing of beasts', so that Glamboth in 
                  origin meant more or less 'the Yelling-horde', with reference 
                  to the horrible clamour of the Orcs in battle or when in 
                  pursuit - they could be stealthy enough at need. But Glamhoth 
                  became so firmly associated with Orcs that Glam alone could be 
                  used of any body of Orcs, and a singular form was made from 
                  it, glamog. (Compare the name of the sword Glamdring.) 
                  <BR>Note. The word used in translation of Q urko, S orch, is 
                  Orc. But that is because of the similarity of the ancient 
                  English word orc, 'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. 
                  There is possibly no connexion between them. The English word 
                  is now generally supposed to be derived from Latin Orcus. The 
                  word for Orc in the now forgotten tongue of the Druedain in 
                  the realm of Gondor is recorded as being (? in the plural) 
                  gorgun. This is possibly derived ultimately from the Elvish 
                  words. <BR>Author's Notes to Quendi and Eldar. <BR>Note 27 (p. 
                  390). *(n)guruk is due to a combination of *(g)ruk with *NGUR 
                  'horror', seen in S gorth, gorthob 'horror, horrible', and 
                  (reduplicated) gorgor 'extreme horror'.<BR>Note 28 (p. 390) 
                  Some other derivatives are in Quenya: rukin 'I feel fear or 
                  horror' (constructed with 'from' of the object feared); ruhta- 
                  'terrify'; rukima 'terrible'; rauko and arauko &lt; *grauk-) 
                  'a powerful, hostile, and terrible creature', especially in 
                  the compound Valarauko 'Demon of Might', applied later to the 
                  more powerful and terrible of the Maia servants of Morgoth. In 
                  Sindarin appear, for instance, raug and graug, and the com- 
                  pound Balrog (equivalents of Q rauko, etc.); groga- 'feel 
                  terror'; gruitha 'terrify'; gorog (&lt; *guruk) 
                  'horror'.<BR>/Comm. Note 22 by Christ.Tolk./. Cf. Appendix F 
                  to The Lord of the Rings, p. 409: 'The lesser kinds were 
                  called, especially by the Uruk-hai, snaga "slave".' 
                  <BR><BR>Fr.193a-c.<BR>a. PM (HME12)/Foreword. Note on the 
                  text.<BR>One concerns the translation of the curse of the Orc 
                  from the Dark Tower given on p. 83 / Fr.193b/. When writing 
                  this passage I had forgotten that Mr Carl Hostetter, editor of 
                  the periodical Vinyar Tengwar, had pointed out in the issue 
                  (no. 26) for November 1992 that there is a translation of the 
                  words in a note to one of the typescripts of Appendix E (he 
                  being unaware of the existence of the certainly earlier 
                  version that I have printed); and I had also overlooked the 
                  fact that a third version is found among notes on words and 
                  phrases 'in alien speech' in The Lord of the Rings. All three 
                  differ significantly (bagronk, for example, being rendered 
                  both as 'cesspool' and as 'torture (chamber)'); from which it 
                  seems clear that my father was at this time devising 
                  interpretations of the words, whatever he may have intended 
                  them to mean when he first wrote them.<BR>b. PM (HME12)/1:2. 
                  The Appendix on Languages. Notes. Note 6.<BR>There is scarcely 
                  anything in the last texts that calls for special notice, but 
                  it should be recorded that in the penultimate draft my father 
                  revealed the meaning of the sentence in the Black Speech 
                  uttered by one of the Orcs who was guarding Pippin in the 
                  chapter The Uruk-hai (TT p. 48): Ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug 
                  Saruman-glob bubhosh skai. At the end of the section Orcs and 
                  the Black Speech (RK p. 410) this text reads: ... while the 
                  curse of the Mordor-orc in Chapter 3 of Book Three is in the 
                  more debased form used by the soldiers of the Dark Tower, of 
                  whom Grishnakh was the captain. «Ugluk to the cesspool, sha! 
                  the dungfilth; the great Saruman-fool, skai!» <BR>c. 
                  /H.Fauskanger’s resummarizing/<BR>Then there is the curse of 
                  the Mordor-orc: Uglъk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob 
                  bъbhosh skai (LotR2 III:3). In PM:83, this is translated 
                  "Uglъk to the cesspool, sha! the dungfilth; the great 
                  Saruman-fool, skai!" (There also exists another translation; 
                  see below.) /.../. A quite different translation of the Orkish 
                  curse has been published in Vinyar Tengwar: "Uglъk to the 
                  dung-pit with stinking Saruman-filth, pig-guts, gah!" This 
                  translation seems to be later than the one mentioned above. It

                  Languages. First draft, [§19]. The orcs and goblins had 
                  languages of their own, as hideous as all things that they 
                  made or used; and since some remnant of good will, and true 
                  thought and perception, is required to keep even a base 
                  language alive and useful even for base purposes, their 
                  tongues were endlessly diversified in form, as they were 
                  deadly monotonous in purport, fluent only in the expression of 
                  abuse, of hatred and fear. For which reason they and their 
                  kind used (and still use) the languages of nobler creatures in 
                  such intercourse as they must have between tribe and 
                  tribe.(Note 5 / Fr.195j/) <BR>b. PM (HME12)/1:1. The Appendix 
                  on Languages. First draft, [§12]. /Note confusing Noldor with 
                  goblins in «popular fancy»/. The word Gnomish is used above; 
                  and it would be an apt name, since whatever Paracelsus may 
                  have thought (if indeed he invented the word), to the learned 
                  it suggests know- ledge. And their own true name in High-Elven 
                  is Noldor, Those that Know; for of the Three Kindreds of the 
                  Elves in the beginning, ever the Noldor were distinguished 
                  both by their know- ledge of things that are and were in this 
                  world, and by the desire to know yet more. Yet they were not 
                  in fact in any way like to the gnomes of our learned theory, 
                  and still less to the gnomes of popular fancy in which they 
                  have been confused with dwarves and goblins, and other small 
                  creatures of the earth. They belonged to a race high and 
                  beautiful, the Elder Children of the World, who now are gone. 
                  Tall they were, fairskinned and grey-eyed, though their locks 
                  were dark, and their voices knew more melodies than any mortal 
                  speech that now is heard.<BR>c. PM (HME12)/1:1. The Appendix 
                  on Languages. Later Version, The Languages at the end of the 
                  Third Age /F2+F1/, [§15]. More remarkable it may be thought 
                  that the Common Speech had also been learned by other races, 
                  Dwarves, Orcs, and even Trolls.<BR>d. PM (HME12)/1:1. The 
                  Appendix on Languages. Later Version, The Languages at the end 
                  of the Third Age /F2+F1/, [§16]. The Orcs had a language of 
                  their own, devised for them by the Dark Lord of old, but it 
                  was so full of harsh and hideous sounds and vile words that 
                  other mouths found it difficult to compass, and few indeed 
                  were willing to make the attempt. And these creatures, being 
                  filled with all malice and hatred, so that they did not love 
                  even their own kind, had soon diversified their barbarous and 
                  unwritten speech into as many jargons as there were groups or 
                  settlements of Orcs. Thus they were driven to use the language 
                  of their enemies even in conversing with other Orcs of 
                  different breed or distant dwellings. In the Misty Mountains, 
                  and in other lingering Orc-holds in the far North-west, they 
                  had indeed abandoned their native tongue and used the Common 
                  Speech, though in such a fashion as to make it scarcely less 
                  unlovely than the Orkish. <BR>e. PM (HME12)/1:1. The Appendix 
                  on Languages. Later Version, The Languages at the end of the 
                  Third Age /F2+F1/, [§17]. Trolls, in their beginning creatures 
                  of lumpish and brutal nature, had nothing that could be called 
                  true language of their own; but the evil Power had at various 
                  times made use of them, teaching them what little they could 
                  learn, and even crossing their breed with that of the larger 
                  Orcs. Trolls thus took such language as they could from the 
                  Orcs, and in the west-lands the Trolls of the hills and 
                  mountains spoke a debased form of the Common Westron speech.

                  Version, The Languages at the end of the Third Age /F2+F1/, 
                  [§31]. The speech of Orcs was actually more filthy and 
                  degraded than I have shown it. If I had tried to use an 
                  'English' more near to the reality it would have been 
                  intolerably disgusting and to many readers hardly 
                  intelligible.<BR>g. PM (HME12)/1:1. The Appendix on Languages. 
                  Commentary. <BR>to §16 /of F2+F1/. 'The Orcs had a language of 
                  their own, devised for them by the Dark Lord of old': in view 
                  of what is said in §7, 'the Eldar were at that time engaged in 
                  a ceaseless war with the Dark Lord of that Age, one greater 
                  far than Sauron', this may seem to refer to Morgoth; but cf. 
                  Appendix F (RK p. 409), 'It is said that the Black Speech was 
                  devised by Sauron in the Dark Years'.<BR>h. PM (HME12)/1:1. 
                  The Appendix on Languages. Commentary. <BR>/.../ This is the 
                  most detailed account that my father wrote of his elaborate 
                  and distinctive fiction of translation, of transposition and 
                  substitution. /It says.../ 'Modern English' is lingua franca 
                  spoken by all people (except a few secluded folk like Lorien) 
                  - but little and ill by orcs. <BR>i. PM (HME12)/1:1. The 
                  Appendix on Languages. Late Version, The Languages and Peoples 
                  of the Third Age /F4/. /Comm./. The next typescript, F 4, 
                  still called The Languages of the Third Age but changed to The 
                  Languages and Peoples of the Third Age, followed the major 
                  revision of 1951. My father's long experimentation with the 
                  structure and expression of this Appendix now issued in his 
                  most lucid account of the Elvish languages, in which the terms 
                  Sindar and Sindarin at last appeared, and the acquisition of 
                  the Grey-elven tongue by the exiled Noldor. <BR>Lastly, it was 
                  in F 4 that there entered the passage concerning the new race 
                  of Trolls that appeared at the end of the Third Age. Here the 
                  name was first Horg-hai, but changed as my father typed the 
                  text to Olg-hai (Olog-hai in RK, p. 410). The account of them 
                  did not differ from the final form except in the statement of 
                  their origin: That Sauron bred them none doubted, though from 
                  what stock was not known. Some held that they were a 
                  cross-breed between trolls and the larger Orcs; others that 
                  they were indeed not trolls at all but giant Orcs. Yet there 
                  was no kinship from the beginning between the stone-trolls and 
                  the Orcs that they might breed together;(Note 5 / Fr.195j/) 
                  while the Olg-hai were in fashion of mind and body quite 
                  unlike even the largest of Orc- kind. <BR>j. PM (HME12)/1:1. 
                  The Appendix on Languages. Notes. Note 5. <BR>With this cf. 
                  the passage in F 2 concerning Trolls (p. 36, §17 / Fr.195e/): 
                  'the evil Power had at various times made use of them, 
                  teaching them what little they could learn, and even crossing 
                  their breed with that of the larger Orcs.' <BR>k. The Lord of 
                  the Rings. Appendix F I. The Languages and Peoples of the 
                  Third Age.<BR>O rcs and the Black Speech. Orc is the form of 
                  the name that other races had for this foul people as it was 
                  in the language of Rohan. In Sindarin it was orch. Related, no 
                  doubt, was the word uruk of the Black Speech, though this was 
                  applied as a rule only to the great soldier-orcs that at this 
                  time issued from Mordor and Isengard. The lesser kinds were 
                  called, especially by the Uruk-hai, snaga 'slave'.<BR>The Orcs 
                  were first bred by the Dark Power of the North in the Elder 
                  Days. It is said that they bad no language of their own, but 
                  took what they could of other tongues and perverted it to 
                  their own liking; yet they made only brutal jargons, scarcely 
                  sufficient even for their own needs, unless it were for curses 
                  and abuse. And these creatures, being filled with malice, 
                  hating even their own kind, quickly developed as many 
                  barbarous dialects as there were groups or settlements of 
                  their race, so that their Orkish speech was of little use to 
                  them in intercourse between different tribes.<BR>So it was 
                  that in the Third Age Orcs used for communication between 
                  breed and breed the Westron tongue; and many indeed of the 
                  older tribes, such as those that still lingered in the North 
                  and in the Misty Mountains, had long used the Westron as their 
                  native language, though in such a fashion as to make it hardly 
                  less unlovely than Orkish. In this jargon tark, 'man of 
                  Gondor', was a debased form of tarkil, a Quenya word used in 
                  Westron for one of Numenorean descent; see III.<BR>It is said 
                  that the Black Speech was devised by Sauron in the Dark Years, 
                  and that he bad desired to make it the language of all those 
                  that served him, but he failed in that purpose. From the Black 
                  Speech, however, were derived many of the words that were in 
                  the Third Age wide-spread among the Orcs, such as ghвsh 
                  'fire', but after the first overthrow of Sauron this language 
                  in its ancient form was forgotten by all but the Nazgыl. When 
                  Sauron arose again, it became once more the language of 
                  Barad-dыr and of the captains of Mordor. The inscription on 
                  the Ring was in the ancient Black Speech, while the curse of 
                  the Mordor-orc in II, 53. was in the more debased form used by 
                  the soldiers of the Dark Tower, of whom Grishnбkh was the 
                  captain. Sharku in that tongue means old man.<BR>Trolls. Troll 
                  has been used to translate the Sindarin Torog. In their 
                  beginning far back in the twilight of the Elder Days, these 
                  were creatures of dull and lumpish nature and had no more 
                  language than beasts. But Sauron had made use of them, 
                  teaching them what little they could learn, and increasing 
                  their wits with wickedness. Trolls therefore took such 
                  language as they could master from the Orcs; and in the 
                  Westlands the Stone-trolls spoke a debased form of the Common 
                  Speech.<BR>But at the end of the Third Age a troll-race not 
                  before seen appeared in southern Mirkwood and in the mountain 
                  borders of Mordor. Olog-hai they were called in the Black 
                  Speech. That Sauron bred them none doubted, though from what 
                  stock was not known. Some held that they were not Trolls but 
                  giant Orcs; but the Olog-hai were in fashion of body and mind 
                  quite unlike even the largest of Orc-kind, whom they far 
                  surpassed in size and power. Trolls they were, but filled with 
                  the evil will of their master: a fell race, strong, agile, 
                  fierce and cunning, but harder than stone. Unlike the older 
                  race of the Twilight they could endure the Sun, so long as the 
                  will of Sauron held sway over them. They spoke little, and the 
                  only tongue that they knew was the Black Speech of 
                  Barad-dыr.<BR>l. The Lord of the Rings. Appendix F II. On 
                  Translation.<BR>But Orcs and Trolls spoke as they would, 
                  without love of words or things; and their language was 
                  actually more degraded and filthy than I have shown it I do 
                  not suppose that any will wish for a closer rendering, though 
                  models are easy to find. Much the same sort of talk can still 
                  be heard among the orc-minded; dreary and repetitive with 
                  hatred and contempt, too long removed from good to retain even 
                  verbal vigour, save in the ears of those to whom only the 
                  squalid sounds strong.</FONT></P>

                  North-east. Wild men out of the East crossed Anduin north of 
                  the Emyn Muil and joining with Orcs out of the Misty Mountains 
                  overran the realm (now sparsely populated) north of the White 
                  Mountains, pouring into the wold and plain of 
                  Calenardon.<BR>b. PM (HME12)/1:7. The Heirs of 
                  Elendil.<BR>Sauron stirs up mischief, and there is a great 
                  attack on Gondor. Orcs pour out of the Mountains and of 
                  Mirkwood and join with Easterlings. Hador [&gt; Cirion] gets 
                  help from the North. Eorl the Young wins the victory of the 
                  Field of Celebrant and is given Calenardon or Rohan. <BR>c. PM

                  T3.<BR>2510. A great host of Orcs, with Easterlings as allies, 
                  assail the northern borders of Gondor, and occupy a great part 
                  of Calenardon. Gondor sends for help. Eorl the Young leads his 
                  people, the Eotheod or Rohirrim, out of the North from the 
                  sources of Anduin, and rides to the help of Cirion, Steward of 
                  Gondor. With his aid the great victory of the Field of 
                  Celebrant is won. Elladan and Elrohir rode also in that 
                  battle. From that time forth the brethren never cease from war 
                  with the Orcs because of Celebrian.<BR>d. PM (HME12)/1:9. The 
                  Making of Appendix A. (iii) The House of Eorl. <BR>In the two 
                  thousand five hundred and tenth year of the Third Age a great 
                  peril threatened the land of Gondor in the South and wild men 
                  out of the East assailed its northern borders, allying 
                  themselves with Orcs of the mountains. The invaders overran 
                  and occupied Calenardon, the great plains in the north of the 
                  realm. The Steward of Gondor sent north for help, for there 
                  had ever been friendship between the men of Anduin's vale and 
                  the people of Gondor. Hearing of the need of Gondor from afar 
                  Eorl set out with a great host of riders; and it was chiefly 
                  by his valour and the valour of the horsemen of Eotheod that 
                  victory was obtained. In the great battle of the Field of 
                  Celebrant the Easterlings and Orcs were utterly defeated and 
                  the horsemen of Eorl pursued them over the plains of

                  conquest of Calenardhon. From this deadly peril, which would 
                  have brought ruin upon Gondor, the coming of Eorl the Young

                  Orcs in the passes of the mountains. She is rescued by Elrond 
                  and his sons, but after fear and torment she is no longer 
                  willing to remain in Middle-earth, and she departs to the Grey 
                  Havens and sails over Sea. (Note 32) <BR>Note 32. As in the 
                  earliest text (p. 226 / Fr.198a/), T 3 states that Celebrian 
                  was slain by the Orcs.<BR>c. PM (HME12)/1:9. The Making of 
                  Appendix A. (ii). The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen. <BR>Now the 
                  sons of Elrond did not hunt wild beasts, but they pursued the 
                  Orcs wherever they might find them; and this they did because 
                  of Celebrian their mother, daughter of Galadriel. On a time 
                  long ago, as she passed over the Mountains to visit her mother 
                  in the Land of Lorien, Orcs waylaid the road, and she was 
                  taken captive by them and tormented; and though she was 
                  rescued by Elrond and his sons, and brought home and tended, 
                  and her hurts of body were healed, she lay under a great cloud 
                  of fear and she loved Middle-earth no longer; so that at the 
                  last Elrond granted her prayer, and she passed to the Grey 
                  Havens and went into the West, never to return. Thus it befell 
                  that when Aragorn was only two years of age Arathorn went 
                  riding with the sons of Elrond and fought with Orcs that had 
                  made an inroad into Eriador.<BR>d. The Lord of the Rings.

                  escort being scattered by the sudden assault of the Orcs, she 
                  was seized and carried off. She was pursued and rescued by 
                  Elladan and Elrohir, but not before she had suffered torment 
                  and had received a poisoned wound. She was brought back to 
                  Imladris, and though healed in body by Elrond, lost all 
                  delight in Middle-earth, and the next year went to the Havens 
                  and passed over Sea. And later in the days of Arassuil, Orcs, 
                  multiplying again in the Misty Mountains, begin to ravage the

                  that none are aware of it, until they have great forces hidden 
                  and are ready to bar all the passes from Eriador into Anduin's 
                  vales, according to the plan of their master in Dol Guldur.

                  the scattered Dwarves of Durin's race gather together out of 
                  the North and make war on the Orcs of the Misty Mountains. The 
                  War of the Dwarves and Orcs was long and terrible and fought 
                  largely in the dark in deep places. <BR>3019. /.../ The Host 
                  of the West enters Mordor and destroys all the Orc-holds. All 
                  Men that had allied themselves with Sauron were slain or 
                  subjugated. <BR>Note 35. In very difficult scribbled notes at 
                  the end of T 3 my father asked himself: 'When were the Dwarf 
                  and Goblin wars? When did Moria become finally desolate?' He 
                  noted that since the wars were referred to by Thorin in The 
                  Hobbit they 'must have been recent', and suggested that there 
                  was 'an attempt to enter Moria in Thrain's time', perhaps 'an 
                  expedition from Erebor to Moria'. 'But the appearance of the 
                  Balrog and the desolation of Moria must be more ancient, 
                  possibly as far back as c.1980-2000'. He then wrote: 'After 
                  fall of Erebor Thror tried to visit Moria and was killed by a 
                  goblin. The dwarves assembled a force and fought Orcs on east 
                  side of Moria and did great slaughter, but could not enter 
                  Moria because of "the terror". Dain returns to the Iron Hills, 
                  but Thorin and Thrain wander about.' Entries were then added 
                  to the text of T 3 which were taken up into T 4. At this time 
                  the story was that Thrain and Thorin accompanied Thror, but 
                  made their escape. - Much later the dates of the war were 
                  changed from 2766-9 to 2793-9.<BR><BR>Fr.201.<BR>PM

                  the only difference worth noticing here lies in the sentences 
                  following the words 'made war on the Orcs of the Misty 
                  Mountains in revenge for Thror', which now read: 'Long and 
                  deadly was that war, and it was fought for the most part in 
                  dark places beneath the earth; and at the last the Dwarves had 
                  the victory, and in the Battle before the Gate of Moria ten

                  afterwards. It would seem (from afterknowledge) that no sooner 
                  was he abroad with few companions (and certainly after he came 
                  at length back into Rhovanion) he was hunted by the emissaries 
                  of Sauron. Wolves pursued him, orcs waylaid him, evil birds 
                  shadowed his path, and the more he tried to go north the more 
                  he was driven back.<BR><BR>Fr.204.<BR>PM (HME12)/2:10. Of 
                  Dwarves and Men I /Dwarwes/.<BR>They /Dvarves Longbeards/ 
                  regarded the Iron Hills, the Ered Mithrin, and the east dales 
                  of the Misty Mountains as their own land. But they were under 
                  attack from the Orks of Morgoth. During the War of the Jewels 
                  and the Siege of Angband, when Morgoth needed all his 
                  strength, these attacks ceased; but when Morgoth fell and 
                  Angband was destroyed hosts of the Orks fled eastwards seeking 
                  homes. They were now masterless and without any general 
                  leadership, but they were well-armed and very numerous, cruel, 
                  savage, and reckless in assault. In the battles that followed 
                  the Dwarves were outnumbered, and though they were the most 
                  redoubtable warriors of all the Speaking Peoples they were 
                  glad to make alliance with Men. /.../ <BR>At the same time, 
                  however, /First Half of S.A./ Sauron came out of hiding and 
                  revealed himself in fair form. For long he paid little heed to 
                  Dwarves or Men and endeavoured to win the friendship and trust 
                  of the Eldar. But slowly he reverted again to the allegiance 
                  of Morgoth and began to seek power by force, marshalling again 
                  and directing the Orks and other evil things of the First Age, 
                  and secretly building his great fortress in the mountain-girt 
                  land in the South that was afterwards known as Mordor. /.../ 
                  <BR>/after 1700 S.A./ For though Moria remained impregnable 
                  for many centuries, the Orks reinforced and commanded by 
                  servants of Sauron invaded the mountains again. Gundabad was 
                  re-taken, the Ered Mithrin infested and the communication 
                  between Moria and the Iron Hills for a time cut off. The Men 
                  of the Alliance were involved in war not only with Orks but 
                  with alien Men of evil sort. For Sauron had acquired dominion 
                  over many savage tribes in the East (of old corrupted by 
                  Morgoth), and he now urged them to seek land and booty in the 
                  West.</FONT></P>

                  previous reference to this ancient significance of Mount 
                  Gundabad. That mountain originally appeared in the chapter The 
                  Clouds Burst in The Hobbit, where it is told that the Goblins 
                  'marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel

                  The Hobbit as a great isolated mass at the northern end of the 
                  Misty Mountains where the Grey Mountains drew towards them. In 
                  The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A (III), Gundabad appears in 
                  the account of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs late in the 
                  Third Age, where the Dwarves 'assailed and sacked one by one 
                  all the strongholds of the Orcs that they could [find] from 
                  Gundabad to the Gladden' (the word 'find' was erroneously

                  and largely unnecessary modifications to the original text (in 
                  no case altering the sense) there are a few points to mention 
                  about that printed in Unfinished Tales. (1) The spelling 
                  Ork(s) was changed to Orc(s), and that of the river Taiglin to 
                  Teiglin (see XI.228, 309-10). (2) A passage about the liking 
                  of the Drugs /Druedain/ for edible fungus was omitted in view 
                  of my father's pencilled note beside it: 'Delete all this 
                  about funguses. Too like Hobbits' (a reference of course to 
                  Frodo and Farmer Maggot's mushrooms). This followed the 
                  account of the knowledge of the Drugs concerning plants, and 
                  reads: To the astonishment of Elves and other Men they ate 
                  funguses with pleasure, many of which looked to others ugly 
                  and dangerous; some kinds which they specially liked they 
                  caused to grow near their dwellings. The Eldar did not eat 
                  these things. The Folk of Haleth, taught by the Druedain, made 
                  some use of them at need; and if they were guests they ate 
                  what was provided in courtesy, and without fear. The other 
                  Atani eschewed them, save in great hunger when astray in the 
                  wild, for few among them had the knowledge to distinguish the 
                  wholesome from the bad, and the less wise called them 
                  ork-plants and supposed them to have been cursed and blighted

                  from the 1950s. In a letter of 13 May 1964 (Letters no.256) he 
                  wrote: I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the 
                  Downfall [of Sauron], but it proved both sinister and 
                  depressing. Since we are dealing with Men it is inevitable

                  would become discontented and restless - while the dynasts 
                  descended from Aragorn would become just kings and governors - 
                  like Denethor or worse. I found that even so early there was 
                  an outcrop of revolutionary plots, about a centre of secret 
                  Satanistic religion; while Gondorian boys were playing at 
                  being Orcs and going round doing damage. I could have written 
                  a 'thriller' about the plot and its discovery and overthrow - 
                  but it would be just that. Not worth doing. From the evidence 
                  given above, however, it is seen that his interest in the 
                  story was subsequently reawakened, and even reached the point 
                  of making a new (though incomplete) version of what he had 
                  written of it years before. But in 1972, fifteen months before 
                  his death, he wrote to his friend Douglas Carter (Letters 
                  no.338): I have written nothing beyond the first few years of 
                  the Fourth Age. (Except the beginning of a tale supposed to 
                  refer to the end of the reign of Eldarion about 100 years 
                  after the death of Aragorn. Then I of course discovered that 
                  the King's Peace would contain no tales worth recounting; and 
                  his wars would have little interest after the overthrow of 
                  Sauron; but that almost certainly a restlessness would appear 
                  about then, owing to the (it seems) inevitable boredom of Men 
                  with the good: there would be secret societies practising dark 
                  cults, and 'orc-cults' among adolescents.) <BR>THE NEW SHADOW. 
                  <BR>This tale begins in the days of Eldarion, son of that 
                  Elessar of whom the histories have much to tell. One hundred 
                  and five years had passed since the fall of the Dark Tower, 
                  and the story of that time was little heeded now by most of 
                  the people of Gondor, though a few were still living who could 
                  remember the War of the Ring as a shadow upon their early 
                  childhood. One of these was old Borlas of Pen-arduin. He was 
                  the younger son of Beregond, the first Captain of the Guard of 
                  Prince Faramir, who had removed with his lord from the City to 
                  the Emyn Arnen. <BR>/.../ 'Deep indeed run the roots of Evil,' 
                  said Borlas, 'and the black sap is strong in them. That tree 
                  will never be slain. Let men hew it as often as they may, it 
                  will thrust up shoots again as soon as they turn aside. Not 
                  even at the Feast of Felling should the axe be hung up on the 
                  wall! ' <BR>'Plainly you think you are speaking wise words,' 
                  said Saelon. 'I guess that by the gloom in your voice, and by 
                  the nodding of your head. But what is this all about? Your 
                  life seems fair enough still, for an aged man that does not 
                  now go far abroad. Where have you found a shoot of your dark 
                  tree growing? In your own garden?' <BR>Borlas looked up, and 
                  as he glanced keenly at Saelon he wondered suddenly if this 
                  young man, usually gay and often half mocking, had more in his 
                  mind than appeared in his face.<BR>Borlas had not intended to 
                  open his heart to him, but being burdened in thought he had 
                  spoken aloud, more to himself than his companion. Saelon did 
                  not return his glance. He was humming softly, while he trimmed 
                  a whistle of green willow with a sharp nail-knife. <BR>The two 
                  were sitting in an arbour near the steep eastern shore of 
                  Anduin where it flowed about the feet of the hills of Arnen. 
                  They were indeed in Borlas's garden and his small grey-stone 
                  house could be seen through the trees above them on the 
                  hill-slope facing west. Borlas looked at the river, and at the 
                  trees in their June leaves, and then far off to the towers of 
                  the City under the glow of late afternoon. 'No, not in my 
                  garden,' he said thoughtfully. <BR>'Then why are you so 
                  troubled?' asked Saelon. 'If a man has a fair garden with 
                  strong walls, then he has as much as any man can govern for 
                  his own pleasure.' He paused. 'As long as he keeps the 
                  strength of life in him,' he added. 'When that fails, why 
                  trouble about any lesser ill? For then he must soon leave his 
                  garden at last, and others must look to the weeds.' <BR>Borlas 
                  sighed, but he did not answer, and Saelon went on: 'But there 
                  are of course some who will not be content, and to their 
                  life's end they trouble their hearts about their neighbours, 
                  and the City, and the Realm, and all the wide world. You are 
                  one of them, Master Borlas, and have ever been so, since I 
                  first knew you as a boy that you caught in your orchard. Even 
                  then you were not content to let ill alone: to deter me with a 
                  beating, or to strengthen your fences. No. You were grieved 
                  and wanted to improve me. You had me into your house and 
                  talked to me. 'I remember it well. "Orcs' work," you said many 
                  times. "Stealing good fruit, well, I suppose that is no worse 
                  than boys' work, if they are hungry, or their fathers are too 
                  easy. But pulling down unripe apples to break or cast away! 
                  That is Orcs' work. How did you come to do such a thing, lad?" 
                  <BR>'Orcs' work! I was angered by that, Master Borlas, and too 
                  proud to answer, though it was in my heart to say in child's 
                  words: "If it was wrong for a boy to steal an apple to eat, 
                  then it is wrong to steal one to play with. But not more 
                  wrong. Don't speak to me of Orcs' work, or I may show you 
                  some!" <BR>'It was a mistake, Master Borlas. For I had heard 
                  tales of the Orcs and their doings, but I had not been 
                  interested till then. You turned my mind to them. I grew out 
                  of petty thefts (my father was not too easy), but I did not 
                  forget the Orcs. I began to feel hatred and think of the 
                  sweetness of revenge. We played at Orcs, I and my friends, and 
                  sometimes I thought: "Shall I gather my band and go and cut 
                  down his trees? Then he will think that the Orcs have really 
                  returned." But that was a long time ago,' Saelon ended with a 
                  smile. <BR>Borlas was startled. He was now receiving 
                  confidences, not giving them. And there was something 
                  disquieting in the young man's tone, something that made him 
                  wonder whether deep down, as deep as the roots of the dark 
                  trees, the childish resentment did not still linger. Yes, even 
                  in the heart of Saelon, the friend of his own son, and the 
                  young man who had in the last few years shown him much 
                  kindness in his loneliness. At any rate he resolved to say no 
                  more of his own thoughts to him. <BR>'Alas!' he said, 'we all 
                  make mistakes. I do not claim wisdom, young man, except maybe 
                  the little that one may glean with the passing of the years. 
                  From which I know well enough the sad truth that those who 
                  mean well may do more harm than those who let things be. I am 
                  sorry now for what I said, if it roused hate in your heart. 
                  Though I still think that it was just: untimely maybe, and yet 
                  true. Surely even a boy must understand that fruit is fruit, 
                  and does not reach its full being until it is ripe; so that to 
                  misuse it unripe is to do worse than just to rob the man that 
                  has tended it: it robs the world, hinders a good thing from 
                  fulfilment. Those who do so join forces with all that is 
                  amiss, with the blights and the cankers and the ill winds. And 
                  that was the way of Orcs.' <BR>'And is the way of Men too,' 
                  said Saelon. 'No! I do not mean of wild men only, or those who 
                  grew "under the Shadow", as they say. I mean all Men. I would 
                  not misuse green fruit now, but only because I have no longer 
                  any use for unripe apples, not for your lofty reasons, Master 
                  Borlas. Indeed I think your reasons as unsound as an apple 
                  that has been too long in store. To trees all Men are Orcs. Do 
                  Men consider the fulfilment of the life-story of a tree before 
                  they cut it down? For whatever purpose: to have its room for 
                  tilth, to use its flesh as timber or as fuel, or merely to 
                  open the view? If trees were the judges, would they set Men 
                  above Orcs, or indeed above the cankers and blights? What more 
                  right, they might ask, have Men to feed on their juices than 
                  blights?' <BR>'A man,' said Borlas, 'who tends a tree and 
                  guards it from blights and many other enemies does not act 
                  like an Orc or a canker. If he eats its fruit, he does it no 
                  injury. It produces fruit more abundantly than it needs for 
                  its own purpose: the continuing of its kind.' 'Let him eat the 
                  fruit then, or play with it,' said Saelon. 'But I spoke of 
                  slaying: hewing and burning; and by what right men do such 
                  things to trees.'</FONT></P>

                  You spoke of the judgement of trees in these matters. But 
                  trees are not judges. The children of the One are the masters. 
                  My judgement as one of them you know already. The evils of the 
                  world were not at first in the great Theme, but entered with 
                  the discords of Melkor. Men did not come with these discords; 
                  they entered afterwards as a new thing direct from Eru, the 
                  One, and therefore they are called His children, and all that 
                  was in the Theme they have, for their own good, the right to 
                  use - rightly, without pride or wantonness, but with 
                  reverence.(10) <BR>'If the smallest child of a woodman feels 
                  the cold of winter, the proudest tree is not wronged, if it is 
                  bidden to surrender its flesh to warm the child with fire. But 
                  the child must not mar the tree in play or spite, rip its bark 
                  or break its branches. And the good husbandman will use first, 
                  if he can, dead wood or an old tree; he will not fell a young 
                  tree and leave it to rot, for no better reason than his 
                  pleasure in axe-play. That is orkish. <BR>'But it is even as I 
                  said: the roots of Evil lie deep, and from far off comes the 
                  poison that works in us, so that many do these things - at 
                  times, and become then indeed like the servants of Melkor. But 
                  the Orcs did these things at all times; they did harm with 
                  delight to all things that could suffer it, and they were 
                  restrained only by lack of power, not by either prudence or 
                  mercy. But we have spoken enough of this.' <BR>'Why!' said 
                  Saelon. 'We have hardly begun. It was not of your orchard, nor 
                  your apples, nor of me, that you were thinking when you spoke 
                  of the re-arising of the dark tree. What you were thinking of, 
                  Master Borlas, I can guess nonetheless. I have eyes and ears, 
                  and other senses, Master.' His voice sank low and could 
                  scarcely be heard above the murmur of a sudden chill wind in 
                  the leaves, as the sun sank behind Mindolluin. 'You have heard 
                  then the name?' With hardly more than breath he formed it. 'Of 
                  Herumor?' <BR>Borlas looked at him with amazement and fear. 
                  His mouth made tremulous motions of speech, but no sound came 
                  from it. <BR>'I see that you have,' said Saelon. 'And you seem 
                  astonished to learn that I have heard it also. But you are not 
                  more aston- ished than I was to see that this name has reached 
                  you. For, as I say, I have keen eyes and ears, but yours are 
                  now dim even for daily use, and the matter has been kept as 
                  secret as cunning could contrive.' <BR>'Whose cunning?' said 
                  Borlas, suddenly and fiercely. The sight of his eyes might be 
                  dim, but they blazed now with anger. <BR>'Why, those who have 
                  heard the call of the name, of course,' answered Saelon 
                  unperturbed. 'They are not many yet, to set against all the 
                  people of Gondor, but the number is growing. Not all are 
                  content since the Great King died, and fewer now are afraid.' 
                  <BR>'So I have guessed,' said Borlas, 'and it is that thought 
                  that chills the warmth of summer in my heart. For a man may 
                  have a garden with strong walls, Saelon, and yet find no peace 
                  or con- tent there. There are some enemies that such walls 
                  will not keep out; for his garden is only part of a guarded 
                  realm after all. It is to the walls of the realm that he must 
                  look for his real defence. But what is the call? What would 
                  they do?' he cried, laying his hand on the young man's knee. 
                  <BR>'I will ask you a question first before I answer yours,' 
                  said Saelon; and now he looked searchingly at the old man. 
                  'How have you, who sit here in the Emyn Arnen and seldom go 
                  now even to the City - how have you heard the whispers of this 
                  name?' <BR>Borlas looked down on the ground and clasped his 
                  hands between his knees. For some time he did not answer. At 
                  last he looked up again; his face had hardened and his eyes 
                  were more wary. 'I will not answer that, Saelon,' he said. 
                  'Not until I have asked you yet another question. First tell 
                  me,' he said slowly, 'are you one of those who have listened 
                  to the call?' <BR>A strange smile flickered about the young 
                  man's mouth. 'Attack is the best defence,' he answered, 'or so 
                  the s tell us; but when both sides use this counsel there is a 
                  clash of battle. So I will counter you. I will not answer you, 
                  Master Borlas, until you tell me: are you one of those who 
                  have listened, or no?' <BR>'How can you think it?' cried 
                  Borlas. <BR>'And how can you think it?' asked Saelon. <BR>'As 
                  for me,' said Borlas, 'do not all my words give you the 
                  answer?' <BR>'But as for me, you would say,' said Saelon, 'my 
                  words might make me doubtful? Because I defended a small boy 
                  who threw unripe apples at his playmates from the name of Orc? 
                  Or because I spoke of the suffering of trees at the hands of 
                  men? Master Borlas, it is unwise to judge a man's heart from 
                  words spoken in an argument without respect for your opinions. 
                  They may be meant to disturb you. Pert maybe, but possibly 
                  better than a mere echo. I do not doubt that many of those we 
                  spoke of would use words as solemn as yours, and speak 
                  reverently of the Great Theme and such things - in your 
                  presence. Well, who shall answer first?' <BR>'The younger it 
                  would have been in the courtesy of old,' said Borlas; 'or 
                  between men counted as equals, the one who was first asked. 
                  You are both.' <BR>Saelon smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'Let 
                  me see: the first question that you asked unanswered was: what 
                  is the call, what would they do? Can you find no answer in the 
                  past for all your age and lore? I am young and less learned. 
                  Still, if you really wish to know, I could perhaps make the 
                  whispers clearer to you.' <BR>/.../<BR>Note 10. This passage 
                  in the argument was expressed rather differently in B (which 
                  was following A almost exactly): <BR>'A man,' said Borlas, 
                  'who tends a tree and guards it from blights, and eats its 
                  fruit - which it produces more abundantly than its mere 
                  life-need; not that eating the fruit need destroy the seed - 
                  does not act like a canker, nor like an Orc. <BR>'But as for 
                  the cankers, I wonder. They live, it might be said, and yet 
                  their life is death. I do not believe that they were part of 
                  the Music of the Ainur, unless in the discords of Melkor. And 
                  so with Orcs.' <BR>'And what of Men?' said Arthael. <BR>'Why 
                  do you ask?' said Borlas. 'You know, surely, what is taught? 
                  They were not at first in the Great Music, but they did not 
                  enter with the discords of Melkor: they came from Iluvatar 
                  himself, and therefore they are called the Children of God. 
                  And all that is in the Music they have a right to use - 
                  rightly: which is with reverence, not with pride or 
                  wantonness.' <BR>b. Letters. Letter 183. <BR>In my story I do 
                  not deal in Absolute Evil. I do not think there is such a 
                  thing, since that is Zero. I do not think that at any rate any 
                  'rational being' is wholly evil. Satan fell. In my myth 
                  Morgoth fell before Creation of the physical world. In my 
                  story Sauron represents as near an approach to the wholly evil 
                  will as is possible. He had gone the way of all tyrants: 
                  beginning well, at least on the level that while desiring to 
                  order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first 
                  considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of 
                  the Earth. But he went further than human tyrants in pride and 
                  the lust for domination, being in origin an immortal (angelic) 
                  spirit. In The Lord of the Rings the conflict is not basically 
                  about 'freedom', though that is naturally involved. It is 
                  about God, and His sole right to divine honour. The Eldar and 
                  the Nъmenуreans believed in The One, the true God, and held 
                  worship of any other person an abomination. Sauron desired to 
                  be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants; if he 
                  had been victorious he would have demanded divine honour from 
                  all rational creatures and absolute temporal power over the 
                  whole world. So even if in desperation 'the West' had bred or 
                  hired hordes of orcs and had cruelly ravaged the lands of 
                  other Men as allies of Sauron, or merely to prevent them from 
                  aiding him, their Cause would have remained indefeasibly 
                  right. As does the Cause of those who oppose now the State-God 
                  and Marshal This or That as its High Priest, even if it is 
                  true (as it unfortunately is) that many of their deeds are 
                  wrong, even if it were true (as it is not) that the 
                  inhabitants of 'The West', except for a minority of wealthy 
                  bosses, live in fear and squalor, while the worshippers of the 
                  State-God live in peace and abundance and in mutual esteem and 
                  trust.<BR>So I feel that the fiddle-faddle in reviews, and 
                  correspondence about them, as to whether my 'good people' were 
                  kind and merciful and gave quarter (in fact they do), or not, 
                  is quite beside the point. Some critics seem determined to 
                  represent me as a simple-minded adolescent, inspired with, 
                  say, a With-the-flag-to-Pretoria spirit, and wilfully distort 
                  what is said in my tale. I have not that spirit, and it does 
                  not appear in the story. The figure of Denethor alone is 
                  enough to show this; but I have not made any of the peoples on 
                  the 'right' side, Hobbits, Rohirrim, Men of Dale or of Gondor, 
                  any better than men have been or are, or can be. Mine is not 
                  an 'imaginary' world, but an imaginary historical moment on 
                  'Middle-earth' – which is our 
                  habitation.<BR><BR>Fr.210a-b.<BR>UT/1:1. Of Tuor and his 
                  coming to Gondolin. <BR>a. "Alas, lady, it is known now that 
                  Huor fell at the side of Hъrin his brother; and he lies, I 
                  deem, in the great hill of slain that the Orcs have raised 
                  upon the field of battle." /Nirnaeth/<BR>/.../ Thus it came to 
                  pass that the Elves forsook the caves of Androth, and Tuor 
                  went with them. But their enemies kept watch upon their 
                  dwellings, and were soon aware of their march; and they had 
                  not gone far from the hills into the plain before they were 
                  assailed by a great force of Orcs and Easterlings, and they 
                  were scattered far and wide, fleeing into the gathering night. 
                  A company of Orcs was encamped in the midst of the road, 
                  huddled about a large wood-fire.<BR>"Gurth an Glamhoth!" Tuor 
                  muttered. "Now the sword shall come from under the cloak. I 
                  will risk death for mastery of that fire, and even the meat of 
                  Orcs would be a prize."<BR>"Nay!" said Voronwл. "On this quest 
                  only the cloak will serve. You must forgo the fire, or else 
                  forgo Turgon. This band is not alone in the wild: cannot your 
                  mortal sight see the far flame of other posts to the north and 
                  to the south? A tumult will bring a host upon us.<BR>b. None 
                  now dare to use it /the certain way/ save in desperate need, 
                  neither Elf nor Man nor Orc,<BR><BR>Fr.211.<BR>UT/1:2. Narn I

                  them," said Tъrin, "and he is not happy without them. He says 
                  that we have learned nearly all that we know from them, and 
                  have been made a nobler people; and he says that the Men that 
                  have lately come over the Mountains are hardly better than

                  the Outlaws<BR>Some fifty of these Men had joined in one band, 
                  wandering in the woods beyond the western marches of Doriath; 
                  and they were hated scarcely less than Orcs, for there were 
                  among them outcasts hard of heart, bearing a grudge against 
                  their own kind. /.../<BR>Not long afterwards, as Beleg had 
                  feared, the Orcs came across the Brithiach, and being resisted 
                  with all the force that he could muster by Handir of Brethil 
                  they passed south over the Crossings of Teiglin in search of 
                  plunder. Many of the Woodmen had taken Beleg's counsel and 
                  sent their women and children to ask for refuge in Brethil. 
                  These and their escort escaped, pass-ing over the Crossings in 
                  time; but the armed men that came behind were met by the Orcs, 
                  and the men were worsted. A few fought their way through and 
                  came to Brethil, but many were slain or captured; and the Orcs 
                  passed on to the homesteads, and sacked them and burned them. 
                  Then at once they turned back westwards, seeking the Road, for 
                  they wished now to re-turn North as swiftly as they could with 
                  their booty and their captives.<BR>But the scouts of the 
                  outlaws were soon aware of them; and though they cared little 
                  enough for the captives, the plunder of the Woodmen aroused 
                  their greed. To Tъrin it seemed perilous to reveal themselves 
                  to the Orcs, until their numbers were known; but the outlaws 
                  would not heed him, for they had need of many things in the 
                  wild, and already some began to regret his leading. Therefore 
                  taking one Orleg as his only companion Tъrin went forth to spy 
                  upon the Orcs; and giving command of the band to Andrуg he 
                  charged him to lie close and well hid while they were 
                  gone.<BR>Now the Orc-host was far greater than the band of the 
                  out-laws, but they were in lands to which Orcs had seldom 
                  dared to come, and they knew also that beyond the Road lay the 
                  Talath Dirnen, the Guarded Plain, upon which the scouts and 
                  spies of Nargothrond kept watch; and fearing danger they were 
                  wary, and their scouts went creeping through the trees on 
                  either side of the marching lines. Thus it was that Tъrin and 
                  Orleg were discovered, for three scouts stumbled upon them as 
                  they lay hid; and though they slew two the third escaped, 
                  crying as he ran Golug! Golug! Now that was a name which they 
                  had for the Noldor. At once the forest was filled with Orcs, 
                  scattering silently and hunting far and wide. Then Tъrin, 
                  seeing that there was small hope of escape, thought at least 
                  to deceive them and to lead them away from the hiding-place of 
                  his men; and perceiving from the cry of Golug! that they 
                  feared the spies of Nargothrond, he fled with Orleg westward. 
                  The pursuit came swiftly after them, until turn and dodge as 
                  they would they were driven at last out of the forest; and 
                  then they were espied, and as they sought to cross the Road 
                  Orleg was shot down by many arrows. But Tъrin was saved by his 
                  elven-mail, and escaped alone into the wilds beyond; and by 
                  speed and craft he eluded his enemies, fleeing far into lands 
                  that were strange to him. Then the Orcs, fearing that the 
                  Elves of Nargothrond might be aroused, slew their captives and 
                  made haste away into the North.<BR>Fr.212.<BR>UT/1:2. Narn I 
                  Hin Hurin. Of Mоm the Dwarf. <BR>Then with bitterness he 
                  /Turin/ turned to the men. "You were cruel," he said, "and 
                  cruel without need. Never until now have we tormented a 
                  prisoner; but to such Orc-work such a life as we lead has 
                  brought us. Lawless and fruitless all our deeds have been, 
                  serv-ing only ourselves, and feeding hate in our 
                  hearts."<BR>/.../ But Tъrin came up, and rebuked his men. 
                  "What have you there?" he said. "What need to be so fierce? It 
                  is old and small. What harm is in it?"<BR>"It bites," said 
                  Andrуg, showing his hand that bled. "It is an Orc, or of 
                  Orc-kin. Kill it!"<BR>"It deserved no less, for cheating our 
                  hope," said another, who had taken the sack. "There is nothing 
                  here but roots and small stones."<BR>"Nay," said Tъrin, "it is 
                  bearded. It is only a Dwarf, I guess. Let him up, and 
                  speak."<BR>So it was that Mоm came in to the Tale of the 
                  Children of Hъrin. For he stumbled up on his knees before 
                  Tъrin's feet and begged for his life. "I am old," he said, 
                  "and poor. Only a Dwarf, as you say, and not an Orc. Mоm is my 
                  name. Do not let them slay me, lord, for no cause, as would 
                  the Orcs."<BR><BR>Fr.213.<BR>UT/1:2. Narn I Hin Hurin. The 
                  Coming of Tъrin into Brethil <BR>Then they looked on him with 
                  pity, and Dorlas said: "Seek no more. For an Orc-host came up 
                  from Nargothrond towards the Crossings of Teiglin, and we had 
                  long warning of it: it marched very slow, because of the 
                  number of captives that were led. Then we thought to deal our 
                  small stroke in the war, and we ambushed the Orcs with all the 
                  bowmen we could muster, and hoped to save some of the 
                  prisoners. But alas! as soon as they were assailed the foul 
                  Orcs slew first the women among their captives; and the 
                  daughter of Orodreth they fastened to a tree with a

                  Fields.<BR>/.../ Suddenly as the sun plunged into cloud they 
                  /Isildur and his host/ heard the hideous cries of Orcs, and 
                  saw them issuing from the Forest and moving down the slopes, 
                  yelling their war-cries.<BR>If the keen-eyed Orcs marked their 
                  flight they took no heed. They halted briefly, preparing their 
                  assault. First they let fly a hail of arrows, and then 
                  suddenly with a great shout they did as Isildur would have 
                  done, and hurled a great mass of their chief warriors down the 
                  last slope against the Dunedain, expecting to break up their 
                  shield-wall. But it stood firm. The arrows had been unavailing 
                  against the Numenorean armour. The great Men lowered above the 
                  tallest Orcs, and their swords and spears far outreached the 
                  weapons of their enemies. The onslaught faltered, broke, and 
                  retreated, leaving the defenders little harmed, unshaken, 
                  behind piles of fallen Orcs.<BR>It seemed to Isildur that the 
                  enemy was withdrawing towards the Forest. He looked back. The 
                  red rim of the sun gleamed out from the clouds as it went down 
                  behind the mountains; night would soon be falling. He gave 
                  orders to resume the march at once, but to bend their course 
                  down towards the lower and flat-ter ground where the Orcs 
                  would have less advantage. Maybe he believed that after their 
                  costly repulse they would give way, though their scouts might 
                  follow him during the night and watch his camp. That was the 
                  manner of Orcs, who were most often dismayed when their prey 
                  could turn and bite.<BR>But he was mistaken. There was not 
                  only cunning in the attack, but fierce and relentless hatred. 
                  The Orcs of the Mountains were stiffened and commanded by grim 
                  servants of Barad-dur, sent out long before to watch the 
                  passes (note 20) , and though it was unknown to them the Ring, 
                  cut from his black hand two years before, was still laden with 
                  Sauron's evil will and called to all his servants for their 
                  aid. The Dunedain had gone scarcely a mile when the Orcs moved 
                  again. This time they did not charge, but used all their 
                  forces. They came down on a wide front, which bent into a 
                  crescent and soon closed into an unbroken ring about the 
                  Dunedain. They were silent now, and kept at a distance out of 
                  the range of the dreaded steelbows of Numenor, though the 
                  light was fast failing, and Isildur had all too few archers 
                  for his need. He halted.<BR>There was a pause, though the most 
                  keen-eyed among the D·nedain said that the Orcs were moving 
                  inwards, stealthily, step by step. Elendur went to his father, 
                  who was standing dark and alone, as if lost in thought. 
                  "Atarinya," he said, "what of the power that would cow these 
                  foul creatures and command them to obey you? Is it then of no 
                  avail?"<BR>"Alas, it is not, senya. I cannot use it. I dread 
                  the pain of touching it. And I have not yet found the strength 
                  to bend it to my will. It needs one greater than I now know 
                  myself to be. My pride has fallen. It should go to the Keepers 
                  of the Three".<BR>At that moment there came a sudden blast of 
                  horns, and the Orcs closed in on all sides, flinging 
                  themselves against the Dunedain with reckless ferocity. Night 
                  had come, and hope faded. Men were falling; for some of the 
                  greater Orcs leaped up, two at a time, and dead or alive with 
                  their weight bore down a Dunedain, so that other strong claws 
                  could drag him out and slay him. The Orcs might pay five to 
                  one in this exchange, but it was too cheap. Ciryon was slain 
                  in this way and Aratan mortally wounded in an attempt to 
                  rescue him.<BR>Elendur, not yet harmed, sought Isildur. He was 
                  rallying the men on the east side where the assault was 
                  heaviest, for the Orcs still feared the Elendilmir that he 
                  bore on his brow and avoided him. Elendur touched him on the 
                  shoulder and he turned fiercely, thinking an Orc had crept 
                  behind.<BR>/.../ There he halted, to make sure that he was not 
                  pursued; for Orcs could track a fugitive in the dark by scent, 
                  and needed no eyes. /.../ But to the night-eyed Orcs that 
                  lurked there on the watch he loomed up, a monstrous shadow of 
                  fear, with a piercing eye like a star. They loosed their 
                  poisoned arrows at it, and fled. Needlessly, for Isildur 
                  unarmed was pierced through heart and throat, and without a 
                  cry he fell back into the water. /.../<BR>The tale mentions a 
                  young man who survived the slaughter: he was Elendur's 
                  esquire, named Estelmo, and was one of the last to fall, but 
                  was stunned by a club, and not slain, and was found alive 
                  under Elendur's body. He heard the words of Isildur and 
                  Elendur at their parting. There were rescuers who came on the 
                  scene too late, but in time to disturb the Orcs and prevent 
                  their mutilation of the bodies: for there were certain Woodmen 
                  who got news to Thranduil by runners, and also themselves 
                  gathered a force to ambush the Orcs of which they got wind, 
                  and scat-tered, for though victorious their losses had been 
                  great, and almost all of the great Orcs had fallen: they 
                  attempted no such attack again for long years after.<BR>Note 
                  20. There can be no doubt that Sauron, well-informed of the 
                  Alliance, had sent out such Orc-troops of the Red Eye as he 
                  could spare, to do what they could to harry any forces that 
                  attempted to shorten their road by crossing the Mountains. In 
                  the event the main might of Gil-galad, together with Isildur 
                  and part of the Men of Arnor, had come over the Passes of 
                  Imladris and Caradhras, and the Orcs were dismayed and hid 
                  themselves. But they remained alert and watchful, determined 
                  to attack any companies of Elves or Men that they outnumbered. 
                  Thranduil they had let pass, for even his diminished army was 
                  far too strong for them; but they bided their time, for the 
                  most part hidden in the Forest, while others lurked along the 
                  riverbanks. It is unlikely that any news of Sauron's fall had 
                  reached them, for he had been straitly besieged in Mordor and 
                  all his forces had been destroyed. If any few had escaped, 
                  they had fled far to the East with the Ringwraiths. This small 
                  detachment in the North, of no account, was forgotten. 
                  Probably they thought that Sauron had been victorious, and the 
                  war-scarred army of Thranduil was retreating to hide in 
                  fastnesses of the Forest. Thus they would be emboldened and 
                  eager to win their master's praise, though they had not been 
                  in the main battles. But it was not his praise they would have 
                  won, if any had lived long enough to see his revival. No 
                  tortures would have satisfied his anger with the bungling 
                  fools who had let slip the greatest prize in Middle-earth; 
                  even though they could know nothing of the One Ring, which 
                  save to Sauron himself was known only to the Nine Ringwraiths, 
                  its slaves. Yet many have thought that the ferocity and 
                  determination of their assault on Isildur was in part due to 
                  the Ring. It was little more than two years since it had left 
                  his hand, and though it was swiftly cooling it was still heavy 
                  with his evil will, and seeking all means to return to its 
                  lord (as it did again when he recovered and was re-housed). 
                  So, it is thought, although they did not understand it the 
                  Orc-chiefs were filled with a fierce desire to destroy the 
                  Dъnedain and capture their leader. Nonetheless it proved in 
                  the event that the War of the Ring was lost at the Disaster of 
                  the Gladden Fields. [Author's

                  trusted servants (yet a ruffianly fellow, an outlaw driven 
                  from Dunland, where many said that he had Orc-blood) had 
                  returned from the borders of the Shire, where he had been 
                  negotiating for the purpose of "leaf" and other 
                  supplies.<BR>Note 21. See The Fellowship of the Ring I, 9.

                  caught a glimpse of the Dunlending ("a sallow face with sly, 
                  slanting eyes") in Bill Ferny's house on tin outskirts of 
                  Bree, and thought: "He looks more than half like a
