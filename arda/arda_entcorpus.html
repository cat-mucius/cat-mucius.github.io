					<P align="justify">Перед вами корпус, аналогичный по предназначению <A href="arda_all_about_orcs.html">
							«фрагментам истории орков»</A> и включающий все существенные по содержанию 
						упоминания энтов у Толкиена, какие мне удалось найти. Основной массив данных в 
						этой области принадлежит, разумеется, «Властелину» (энты относительно поздно 
						появились в представлениях Толкиена об Арде и не отразились в более ранних 
						пластах его записей). Вся совокупность данных не оставляет сомнений в том, что 
						энты – древовидные фэйри не-первого поколения. Напомню, что фэйри – это 
						воплотившиеся на продолжительный срок айнур (такие айнур, в принципе, еще 
						могут, утратив плоть, сохранять фэа, в том числе оставаясь в мире, и 
						воплощаться там заново; это - фэйри первого поколения), а также их потомки, 
						прижитые ими во плоти; такие потомки уже жестко связаны с собственной плотью - 
						по той же модели, что и обычные живые твари (изначально сотворенные Илуватаром 
						как плотские существа, а не как духи). К числу таких потомков и относятся энты.
					</P>
					<P align="justify">НБ. Энты именуются «древнейшими из living things» и «древнейшими 
						из разумных creatures». Поскольку, тем не менее, из разряда существ, изначально 
						сотворенных Илуватаром как плотские, первыми считались олвар и келвар, из 
						разумных существ этого разряда древнейшими были эльфы, а первыми из вообще всех 
						сотворенных существ (в том числе разумных) были айнур, мы можем прийти к 
						твердому заключению о том, каков был объем понятия «living things» и 
						«creatures» (в синонимическом смысле к living things) у Толкиена. Это 
						промежуточное понятие, охватывающее все существа, которые появились на свет, 
						уже будучи принципиально жестко связанными со своей плотью (то есть 
						принципиально неспособными сбрасывать ее, оставаясь при этом живыми / 
						способными к новому воплощению), существа, так сказать, «урожденные во плоти». 
						К этой категории относятся
						<BR>
						<BR>
						(а) все потомки первого поколения фэйри (то есть поколения, состоящего из 
						воплотившихся и тесно сросшихся со своей плотью айнур – само это поколение к 
						категории «living things» в точном смысле слова не принадлежит), а также
						<BR>
						<BR>
						(б) все существа, изначально сотворенные Илуватаром как плотские (назовем их 
						условно «хроаринги») – олвар, келвар и, наконец, «хроаринги», от рождения / 
						зачатия наделенные душой фэа (то есть эльфы и пр.).
						<BR>
						<BR>
						У «ливинг сингз» категории (а), то есть фэйри не-первого поколения фэа, 
						разумеется, тоже есть – по наследству от их предков айнур.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						Наконец, категория «разумных creatures» (в значении «разумных living things»; 
						именно в этом смысле Толкиен применяет термин «разумные кричурз» к энтам) 
						включает, очевидно, всех «ливинг сингз», наделенных фэа, а также всех «ливинг 
						сингз», не наделенных фэа, но способных к речи (= и рациональному поведению), в 
						том числе разумные деревья и разумных животных.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						При таком понимании терминов то, что энты именуются «древнейшими ливинг сингз», 
						удивления не вызывает: древнейшими тварями вообще были айнур, древнейшими 
						«ливинг сингзами», то есть существами, которые уже родились как неразрывно 
						связанные при жизни с одной и той же плотской оболочкой, стали древовидные 
						фэйри второго и позднейших поколений – энты (очевидно, фэйри прочих типов 
						начали плотски размножаться после древовидных), древнейшими из «хроарингов» – 
						растения, а древнейшими из «хроарингов», наделенных фэар – эльфы.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						Принадлежат ли к категории «ливинг сингз» орки? Как таковые – очевидно, нет: 
						как было выяснено в своем месте, «орки» – понятие, включающее и урожденных 
						духов, умайар, в разное время вофэйрившихся-воплотившихся как орки (именно к их 
						числу относились первые орки и «Великие Орки»), и орков, которые уже и 
						рождались во плоти («чистокровные» плотские потомки указанных умайар, а также 
						потомство от смешения и самих этих умайар, и их только что названных 
						«чистокровных» потомков с различными прочими «ливинг сингз», включая квенди, 
						людей и обезьян). Урожденные духи, вофэйрившиеся как орки, к категории «ливинг 
						сингз» (существам, урожденным во плоти, см. выше) тем самым не относятся, а, 
						значит, не может быть названа разрядом «ливинг сингз» и включающая названных 
						духов категория «орков» (в целом).
						<BR>
						<BR>
						Это позволяет найти второе решение вопроса о том, почему в «Сильмариллионе» 
						говорится, что при Дагорладе разделились по противоборствующим сторонам «все 
						ливинг сингз» (= все разряды ливинг сингз – там идет речь именно о категориях 
						ливинг сингз, а не об отдельных их особях!) Арды, - притом, что на орков, как 
						остается признать, эта информация не распространяется (еще бы они выступали на 
						стороне Гил-Галада!). Первым решением было бы то, что авторы данного сообщения 
						отталкивались от той распространенной у «Детей Эру» версии, что орки – 
						биороботы, сотворенные из минералов, а не живые существа в точном смысле слова 
						(эта традиция отражена в «Лостах» и др.). Но есть и более простое решение: 
						орков при составлении этого сообщения не учитывали, поскольку речь в нем шла о 
						поведении <u>разрядов</u> «ливинг сингзов», а категория «орков» к числу таких 
						разрядов, как было только что показано, не относилась.

						No one knew whence they (Ents) came or first appeared. The High Elves said that 
						the Valar did not mention them in the 'Music'. But some (Galadriel) were [of 
						the] opinion that when Yavanna discovered the mercy of Eru to Aule in the 
						matter of the Dwarves, she besought Eru (through Manwe) asking him to give life 
						to things made of living things not stone, and that the Ents were either souls 
						sent to inhabit trees, or else that slowly took the likeness of trees owing to 
						their inborn love of trees. (Not all were good [words illegible]) The Ents thus 
						had mastery over stone. The males were devoted to Orome, but the Wives to 
						Yavanna.

						Then Yavanna was silent and looked into her own thought. And she answered: 
						'Because my heart is anxious, thinking of the days to come. All my works are 
						dear to me. Is it not enough that Melkor should have marred so many? Shall 
						nothing that I have devised be free from the dominion of others?'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						'If thou hadst thy will what wouldst thou reserve?' said Manwe. 'Of all thy 
						realm what dost thou hold dearest?'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						'All have their worth,' said Yavanna, 'and each contributes to the worth of the 
						others. But the kelvar can flee or defend themselves, whereas the olvar that 
						grow cannot. And among these I hold trees dear. Long in the growing, swift 
						shall they be in the felling, and unless they pay toll with fruit upon bough 
						little mourned in their passing. So I see in my thought. Would that the trees 
						might speak on behalf of all things that have roots, and punish those that 
						wrong them!'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						This is a strange thought,' said Manwe.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						'Yet it was in the Song,' said Yavanna. 'For while thou wert in the heavens and 
						with Ulmo built the clouds and poured out the rains, I lifted up the branches 
						of great trees to receive them, and some sang to Iluvatar amid the wind and the 
						rain.'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						Then Manwe sat silent, and the thought of Yavanna that she had put into his 
						heart grew and unfolded; and it was beheld by Iluvatar. Then it seemed to Manwe 
						that the Song rose once more about him, and he heeded now many things therein 
						that though he had heard them he had not heeded before. And at last the Vision 
						was renewed, but it was not now remote, for he was himself within it, and yet 
						he saw that all was upheld by the hand of Iluvatar; and the hand entered in, 
						and from it came forth many wonders that had until then been hidden from him in 
						the hearts of the Ainur.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						Then Manwe awoke, and he went down to Yavanna upon Ezellohar, and he sat beside 
						her beneath the Two Trees. And Manwe said: 'O Kementari, Eru hath spoken, 
						saying: "Do then any of the Valar suppose that I did not hear all the Song, 
						even the least sound of the least voice? Behold! When the Children awake, then 
						the thought of Yavanna will awake also, and it will summon spirits from afar, 
						and they will go among the kelvar and the olvar, and some will dwell therein, 
						and be held in reverence, and their just anger shall be feared. For a time: 
						while the Firstborn are in their power, and while the Secondborn are young." 
						But dost them not now remember, Kementari, that thy thought sang not always 
						alone? Did not thy thought and mine meet also, so that we took wing together 
						like great birds that soar above the clouds? That also shall come to be by the 
						heed of Iluvatar, and before the Children awake there shall go forth with wings 
						like the wind the Eagles of the Lords of the West.'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						Then Yavanna was glad, and she stood up, reaching her arms towards the heavens, 
						and she said: 'High shall climb the trees of Kementari, that the Eagles of the 
						King may house therein!'
						<BR>
						<BR>
						But Manwe rose also, and it seemed that he stood to such a height that his 
						voice came down to Yavanna as from the paths of the winds.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						'Nay,' he said, 'only the trees of Aule will be tall enough. In the mountains 
						the Eagles shall house, and hear the voices of those who call upon us. But in 
						the forests shall walk the Shepherds of the Trees.'

						Then Beren arose and left Tol Galen, and summoning to him Dior his son they 
						went north to the River Ascar; and with them went many of the Green-elves of 
						Ossiriand.

						Thus it came to pass that when the Dwarves of Nogrod, returning from Menegroth 
						with diminished host, came again to Sarn Athrad, they were assailed by unseen 
						enemies; for as they climbed up Gelion's banks burdened with the spoils of 
						Doriath, suddenly all the woods were filled with the sound of elven-horns, and 
						shafts sped upon them from every side. There very many of the Dwarves were 
						slain in the first onset; but some escaping from the ambush held together, and 
						fled eastwards towards the mountains. And as they climbed the long slopes 
						beneath Mount Dolmed there came forth the Shepherds of the Trees, and they 
						drove the Dwarves into the shadowy woods of Ered Lindon: whence, it is said, 
						came never one to climb the high passes that led to their homes.

						But I can foresee one action that they /Ents/ took, not without a bearing on 
						The L.R. It was in Ossiriand, a forest country, secret and mysterious before 
						the west feet of the Ered Luin, that Beren and Luthien dwelt for a while after 
						Beren's return from the Dead (I p. 206). Beren did not show himself among 
						mortals again, except once. He intercepted a dwarf-army that had descended from 
						the mountains, sacked the realm of Doriath and slain King Thingol, Luthien's 
						father, carrying off a great booty, including Thingol's necklace upon which 
						hung the Silmaril. There was a battle about a ford across one of the Seven 
						Rivers of Ossir, and the Silmaril was recovered, and so came down to Dior 
						Beren's son, and to Elwing Dior's daughter and Earendel her husband (father of 
						Elros and Elrond). It seems clear that Beren, who had no army, received the aid 
						of the Ents - and that would not make for love between Ents and Dwarves. (...)

						feels cool up here.'
						<BR>
						'Yes,' said Pippin; 'I'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it will all 
						go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so different in the 
						sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.'
						<BR>
						'Almost felt you liked the Forest! That's good! That's uncommonly kind of you,' 
						said a strange voice. 'Turn round and let me have a look at your faces. I 
						almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. Turn round!' A 
						large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, and they were 
						twisted round, gently but irresistibly; then two great arms lifted them up.
						<BR>
						They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to 
						a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very 
						sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff 
						like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say. 
						At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, 
						but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each. The 
						lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, 
						almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment the 
						hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now surveying them, 
						slow and solemn, but very penetrating. They were brown, shot with a green 
						light. Often afterwards Pippin tried to describe his first impression of them.
						<BR>
						'One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of 
						memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with 
						the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the 
						ripples of a very deep lake. I don't know but it felt as if something that grew 
						in the ground-asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something 
						between roof-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked 
						up, and was considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its 
						own inside affairs for endless years.'
						<BR>
						'Hrum, Hoom,' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind 
						instrument. 'Very odd indeed! Do not be hasty, that is my motto. But if I had 
						seen you, before I heard your voices – I liked them: nice little voices; they 
						reminded me of something I cannot remember – if I had seen you before I heard 
						you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little Orcs, and found 
						out my mistake afterwards. Very odd you are, indeed. Root and twig, very odd!'
						<BR>
						Pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he felt a 
						curious suspense, but not fear. 'Please.' he said, 'who are you? And what are 
						you?'
						<BR>
						A queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells were 
						covered over. 'Hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, I am an Ent, or that's 
						what they call me. Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am, you might say, in your 
						manner of speaking. Fangorn is my name according to some, Treebeard others make 
						it. Treebeard will do.'
						<BR>
						'An Ent?' said Merry. 'What's that? But what do you call yourself? What's your 
						real name?'
						<BR>
						'Hoo now!' replied Treebeard. 'Hoo! Now that would be telling! Not so hasty. 
						And I am doing the asking. You are in my country. What are you, I wonder? I 
						cannot place you. You do not seem to come in the old lists that I learned when

						said Merry. 'Yet we've been about for quite a long time. We're hobbits.'
						<BR>
						'Why not make a new line?' said Pippin.
						<BR>
						'Half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers.
						<BR>
						Put us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you've got it.'
						<BR>
						'Hm! Not bad, not bad,' said Treebeard. 'That would do. So you live in holes, 
						eh? It sounds very right and proper. Who calls you hobbits, though? That does 
						not sound elvish to me. Elves made all the old words: they began it.'
						<BR>
						'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said Pippin.
						<BR>
						'Hoom, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call yourselves hobbits? But you should 
						not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right names if 
						you're not careful.'
						<BR>
						'We aren't careful about that,' said Merry. 'As a matter of fact I'm a 
						Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.'
						<BR>
						'And I'm a Took, Peregrin Took, but I'm generally called Pippin, or even Pip.'
						<BR>
						'Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,' said Treebeard. 'I am honoured by your 
						confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There are Ents and 
						Ents, you know; or there are Ents and things that look like Ents but ain't, as 
						you might say. I'll call you Merry and Pippin if you please – nice names. For I 
						am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer half-knowing, 
						half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 'For one thing it 
						would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very 
						long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of 
						the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say. 
						It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, 
						because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to 
						say, and to listen to.
						<BR>
						'But now,' and the eyes became very bright and 'present', seeming to grow 
						smaller and almost sharp, 'what is going on? What are you doing in it all? I 
						can see and hear (and smell and feel) a great deal from this, from this, from 
						this a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-burume. Excuse me: that is a part of 
						my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside languages: you 
						know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine mornings, and 
						think about the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood, and the horses, and the 
						clouds, and the unfolding of the world. What is going on? What is Gandalf up 
						to? And these – burarum,' he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a 
						great organ – 'these Orcs, and young Saruman down at Isengard? I like news. But 
						not too quick now.'
						<BR>
						'There is quite a lot going on,' said Merry: 'and even if we tried to be quick, 
						it would take a long time to tell. But you told us not to be hasty. Ought we to 
						tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we asked what you are 
						going to do with us, and which side you are on? And did you know Gandalf?'
						<BR>
						'Yes, I do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees ' said 
						Treebeard. 'Do you know him?'
						<BR>
						'Yes,' said Pippin sadly, 'we did. He was a great friend, and he was our 
						guide.'
						<BR>
						'Then I can answer your other questions,' said Treebeard. 'I am not going to do 
						anything with you: not if you mean by that 'do something to you' without your 
						leave. We might do some things together. I don't know about sides. I go my own 
						way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But you speak of Master 
						Gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an end.'
						<BR>
						'Yes, we do,' said Pippin sadly. 'The story seems to be going on, but I am 
						afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.'
						<BR>
						'Hoo, come now!' said Treebeard. 'Hoom, hm, ah well.' He paused, looking long 
						at the hobbits: 'Hoom, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come now!'
						<BR>
						'If you would like to hear more. said Merry, 'we will tell you. But it will 
						take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us down? Couldn't we sit here together 
						in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us up.'
						<BR>
						'Hm, tired? No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not sit 
						down. I am not very, hm, bendable. But there, the Sun is going in. Let us leave 
						this – did you say what you call it?'
						<BR>
						'Hill?' suggested Pippin. 'Shelf? Step?' suggested Merry.
						<BR>
						Treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. 'Hill. Yes, that was it. But it is a 
						hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of the world 
						was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.'
						<BR>
						'Where shall we go?' asked Merry.
						<BR>
						'To my home, or one of my homes,' answered Treebeard.
						<BR>
						'Is it far?'
						<BR>
						'I do not know. You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that matter?'
						<BR>
						'Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said Merry. 'We have only a 
						little food.'
						<BR>
						'O! Hm! You need not trouble about that,' said Treebeard. 'I can give you a 
						drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And if we 
						decide to part company, I can set you down outside my country at any point you 
						choose. Let us go!'
						<BR>
						Holding the hobbits gently but firmly, one in the crook of each arm, Treebeard 
						lifted up first one large foot and then the other, and moved them to the edge 
						of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the rocks. Then carefully and solemnly, 
						he stalked down from step to step, and reached the floor of the Forest.
						<BR>
						At once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trees, deeper and 
						deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing steadily up towards 
						the slopes of the mountains. Many of the trees seemed asleep, or as unaware of 
						him as of any other creature that merely passed by; but some quivered, and some 
						raised up their branches above his head as he approached. All the while, as he 
						walked, he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds.
						<BR>
						The hobbits were silent for some time. They felt, oddly enough, safe and 
						comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. At last 
						Pippin ventured to speak again.
						<BR>
						'Please, Treebeard,' he said, 'could I ask you something? Why did Celeborn warn 
						us against your forest? He told us not to risk getting entangled in it.'
						<BR>
						'Hmm, did he now?' rumbled Treebeard. 'And I might have said much the same, if 
						you had been going the other way. Do not risk getting entangled in the woods of 
						Laurelindorenan! That is what the Elves used to call it, but now they make the 
						name shorter: Lothlorien they call it. Perhaps they are right: maybe it is 
						fading; not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, that was it, once upon 
						a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is a queer place, and not 
						for just any one to venture in. I am surprised that you ever got out, but much 
						more surprised that you ever got in: that has not happened to strangers for 
						many a year. It is a queer land.
						<BR>
						'And so is this. Folk have come to grief here. Aye, they have, to grief. 
						Laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinorn&#233;lion ornemalin,' he hummed to 
						himself. 'They are falling rather behind the world in there, I guess,' he said 
						'Neither this country, nor anything else outside the Golden Wood, is what it 
						was when Celeborn was young. Still:
						<BR>
						Taurelilomea-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurea Lomeanor,
						<BR>
						that is what they used to say. Things have changed, but it is still true in 
						places.'
						<BR>
						'What do you mean?' said Pippin. 'What is true?'
						<BR>
						'The trees and the Ents,' said Treebeard. (…/he speaks about Huorns, see [32]/) 
						Aye, aye, there was all one wood once upon a time: from here to the Mountains 
						of Lune, and this was just the East End. Those were the broad days! Time was 
						when I could walk and sing all day and hear no more than the echo of my own 
						voice in the hollow hills. The woods were like the woods of Lothlorien. only 
						thicker stronger, younger. And the smell of the air! I used to spend a week 
						just breathing.'
						<BR>
						Treebeard fell silent, striding along, and yet making hardly a sound with his 
						great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmuring chant. 
						Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them:
						<BR>
						In the willow-meads of Tasarinan I walked in the Spring.
						<BR>
						Ah! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion!
						<BR>
						And I said that was good.
						<BR>
						I wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand.
						<BR>
						Ah! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir!
						<BR>
						And I thought that was best
						<BR>
						To the beeches of Neldoreth I came in the Autumn.
						<BR>
						Ah! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn in 
						Taur-na-neldor!
						<BR>
						It was more than my desire.
						<BR>
						To the pine-trees upon the highland of Dorthonion I climbed in the Winter.
						<BR>
						Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon 
						Orod-na-Thon!
						<BR>
						My voice went up and sang in the sky.
						<BR>
						And now all those lands lie under the wave.
						<BR>
						And I walk in Ambarona, in Tauremorna, in Aldalome.
						<BR>
						In my own land, in the country of Fangorn,
						<BR>
						Where the roots are long,
						<BR>
						And the years lie thicker than the leaves
						<BR>
						In Tauremornalome.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						He ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear could 
						reach, there was not a sound.
						<BR>
						The day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. At last the 
						hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the 
						feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras. Down the 
						hillside the young Entwash, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisily 
						from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there was a long 
						slope, clad with grass, now grey in the twilight. No trees grew there and it 
						was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of 
						cloud.
						<BR>
						Treebeard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Suddenly before them 
						the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one on either 
						side, like living gate-posts; but there was no gate save their crossing and 
						interwoven boughs. As the old Ent approached, the trees lifted up their 
						branches, and all their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were evergreen 
						trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the twilight. 
						Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great hall had 
						been cut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped upwards, 
						until they were fifty feet high or more, and along each wall stood an aisle of 
						trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards.
						<BR>
						At the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bottom it had been hollowed 
						back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the hall, save 
						the branches of the trees, which at the inner end overshadowed all the ground 
						leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream escaped from the 
						springs above, and leaving the main water, fell tinkling down the sheer face of 
						the wall, pouring in silver drops, like a fine curtain in front of the arched 
						bay. The water was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between the 
						trees, and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path, out to 
						rejoin the Entwash in its journey through the forest.
						<BR>
						'Hm! Here we are!' said Treebeard, breaking his long silence. 'I have brought 
						you about seventy thousand ent-strides, but what that comes to in the 
						measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots of the 
						Last Mountain. Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if it were 
						turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight.' He set them 
						down on the grass between the aisles of the trees, and they followed him 
						towards the great arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees 
						hardly bent, but his legs opened in a great stride. He planted his big toes 
						(and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the ground first, before any 
						other part of his feet.
						<BR>
						For a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring, and took a 
						deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table stood 
						there, but no chairs. At the back of the bay it was already quite dark. 
						Treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table. They seemed to 
						be filled with water; but he held his hands over them, and immediately they 
						began to glow, one with a golden and the other with a rich green light; and the 
						blending of the two lights lit the bay; as if the sun of summer was shining 
						through a roof of young leaves. Looking back, the hobbits saw that the trees in 
						the court had also begun to glow, faintly at first, but steadily quickening, 
						until every leaf was edged with light: some green, some gold, some red as 
						copper; while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous 
						stone.
						<BR>
						'Well, well, now we can talk again,' said Treebeard. 'You are thirsty I expect. 
						Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!' He went to the back of the bay, and 
						then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy lids. He 
						removed one of the lids, and dipped in a great ladle, and with it filled three 
						bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones.
						<BR>
						'This is an ent-house,' he said, 'and there are no seats, I fear. But you may 
						sit on the table.' Picking up the hobbits he set them on the great stone slab, 
						six feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling their legs, and drinking 
						in sips.
						<BR>
						The drink was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had 
						drunk from the Entwash near, the borders of the forest, and yet there was some 
						scent or savour in it which they could not describe: it was faint, but it 
						reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze 
						at night. The effect of the draught began at the toes, and rose steadily 
						through every limb, bringing refreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards, 
						right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their 
						heads was actually standing up, waving and curling and growing. As for 
						Treebeard, he first laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch, and then he 
						drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow draught. The hobbits thought he 
						would never stop.
						<BR>
						At last he set the bowl down again. 'Ah – ah,' he sighed. 'Hm, hoom, now we can 
						talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will lie down; that will prevent 
						this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.'
						<BR>
						On the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not more than a 
						couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. Treebeard lowered 
						himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his 
						middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up 
						at the ceiling, upon which lights were flickering, like the play of leaves in 
						the sunshine. Merry and Pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass.
						<BR>
						'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said Treebeard.
						<BR>
						The hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they 
						left Hobbiton. They followed no very clear order, for they interrupted one 
						another continually, and Treebeard often stopped the speaker, and went back to 
						some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later events. They 
						said nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why they set out or 
						where they were going to; and he did not ask for any reasons.
						<BR>
						He was immensely interested in everything: in the Black Riders, in Elrond, and 
						Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of Moria, and in 
						Lothlorien and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and its country over 
						and over again. He said an odd thing at this point. 'You never see any, hm, any 
						Ents round there do you?' he asked. 'Well, not Ents, Entwives I should really 
						say.'
						<BR>
						'Entwives?' said Pippin. 'Are they like you at all?'
						<BR>
						'Yes, hm, well no: I do not really know now,' said Treebeard thoughtfully. 'But 
						they would like your country, so I just wondered.'
						<BR>
						Treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned 
						Gandalf; and most interested of all in Saruman's doings. The hobbits regretted 
						very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by 
						Sam of what Gandalf had told the Council. But they were clear at any rate that 
						Ugluk and his troop came from Isengard, and spoke of Saruman as their master.
						<BR>
						'Hm, hoom!' said Treebeard, when at last their story had wound and wandered 
						down to the battle of the Orcs and the Riders of Rohan. 'Well, well! That is a 
						bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me all, no indeed, not by a 
						long way. But I do not doubt that you are doing as Gandalf would wish. There is 
						something very big going on, that I can see, and what it is maybe I shall learn 
						in good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, but it is a strange business: 
						up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the Nine 
						forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and Gandalf takes them on a great 
						journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them 
						down all the leagues of Wilderland: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great 
						storm. I hope they weather it!'
						<BR>
						'And what about yourself?' asked Merry.
						<BR>
						'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled about the Great Wars,' said Treebeard; 'they 
						mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards are 
						always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am 
						not altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether on my side, if 
						you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even 
						Elves nowadays. Still, I take more kindly to Elves than to others: it was the 
						Elves that cured us of dumbness long ago, and that was a great gift that cannot 
						be forgotten, though our ways have parted since. And there are some things, of 
						course, whose side I am altogether not on; I am against them altogether: these 
						– burarum' (he again made a deep rumble of disgust)' – these Orcs, and their 
						masters.
						<BR>
						'I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when it removed to 
						Mordor, I did not trouble for a while: Mordor is a long way away. But it seems 
						that the wind is setting East, and the withering of all woods may be drawing 
						near. There is naught that an old Ent can do to hold back that storm: he must 
						weather it or crack.
						<BR>
						'But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must do 
						something, I suppose. I have often wondered lately what I should do about 
						Saruman.'
						<BR>
						'Who is Saruman?' asked Pippin. 'Do you know anything about his history?' 
						'Saruman is a Wizard,' answered Treebeard. 'More than that I cannot say. I do 
						not know the history of Wizards. They appeared first after the Great Ships came 
						over the Sea; but if they came with the Ships I never can tell. Saruman was 
						reckoned great among them, I believe. He gave up wandering about and minding 
						the affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago – you would call it a very long 
						time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or Isengard as the Men of Rohan 
						call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but his fame began to grow. He was 
						chosen to be head of the White Council, they say; but that did not turn out too 
						well. I wonder now if even then Saruman was not turning to evil ways. But at 
						any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours. I used to talk to him. 
						There was a time when he was always walking about my woods. He was polite in 
						those days, always asking my leave (at least when he met me); and always eager 
						to listen. I told him many things that he would never have found out by 
						himself; but he never repaid me in like kind. I cannot remember that he ever 
						told. me anything. And he got more and more like that; his face, as I remember 
						it – I have not seen it for many a day – became like windows in a stone wall: 
						windows with shutters inside.
						<BR>
						'I think that I now understand what he is up to. He is plotting to become a 
						Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing 
						things, except as far as they serve him for the moment. And now it is clear 
						that he is a black traitor. He has taken up with foul folk, with the Orcs. Brm, 
						hoom! Worse than that: he has been doing something to them; something 
						dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a mark of evil 
						things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the Sun; but 
						Saruman's Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder what he has done? 
						Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of Orcs and Men? That 
						would be a black evil!'
						<BR>
						Treebeard rumbled for a moment, as if he were pronouncing some deep, 
						subterranean Entish malediction. 'Some time ago I began to wonder how Orcs 
						dared to pass through my woods so freely,' he went on. 'Only lately did I guess 
						that Saruman was to blame, and that long ago he had been spying out all the 
						ways, and discovering my secrets. He and his foul folk are making havoc now. 
						Down on the borders they are felling trees-good trees. Some of the trees they 
						just cut down and leave to rot – orc-mischief that; but most are hewn up and 
						carried off to feed the fires of Orthanc. There is always a smoke rising from 
						Isengard these days.
						<BR>
						'Curse him, root and branch! Many of those trees were my friends creatures I 
						had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their own that are lost for 
						ever now. And there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were 
						singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must stop!'
						<BR>
						Treebeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, and thumped his 
						hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame. 
						There was a flicker like green fire in his eyes, and his beard stood out stiff 
						as a great besom.
						<BR>
						'I will stop it!' he boomed. 'And you shall come with me. You may be able to 
						help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if Saruman is 
						not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front. Our 
						roads go together – to Isengard!'
						<BR>
						'We will come with you,' said Merry. 'We will do what we can.'
						<BR>
						'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown. I should 
						like to be there, even if I could not be of much use: I shall never forget 
						Ugluk and the crossing of Rohan.'
						<BR>
						'Good! Good!' said Treebeard. 'But I spoke hastily. We must not be hasty. I 
						have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; fur it is easier to shout 
						stop! than to do it.'
						<BR>
						He strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain of the 
						spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the drops of water fell 
						glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green sparks. He 
						came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent.
						<BR>
						After some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again. He seemed to be counting 
						on his fingers. 'Fangorn, Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed. 'The trouble 
						is that there are so few of us left,' he said turning towards the hobbits. 
						'Only three remain of the first Ents that walked in the woods before the 
						Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and Finglas and Fladrif – to give them their 
						Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you like that better. 
						And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for this business. 
						Leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has taken to 
						standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the deep grass of 
						the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He used to rouse up 
						in winter; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then. Skinbark 
						lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is where the worst trouble 
						has been. He was wounded by the Orcs, and many of his folk and his tree-herds 
						have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up into the high places, among 
						the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down. Still, I daresay I 
						could get together a fair company of our younger folks – if I could make them 
						understand the need: if I could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk. What a 
						pity there are so few of us!'
						<BR>
						'Why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long?' asked 
						Pippin. 'Have a great many died?'
						<BR>
						'Oh, no!' said Treebeard. 'None have died from inside, as you might say. Some 
						have fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and more have 
						grown tree-ish /cf. V/. But there were never many of us and we have not 
						increased. There have been no Entings – no children, you would say, not for a 
						terrible long count of years. You see, we lost the Entwives. '(…/ he tells the 
						story of Entwives, see further [28]/)
						<BR>
						'Lie down to sleep!' said Treebeard. 'Why of course you do! Hm, hoom: I was 
						forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost thought that 
						I was talking to young Entings, I did. Well, you can lie on the bed. I am going 
						to stand in the rain. Good night!'
						<BR>
						Merry and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and 
						fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died down, and the 
						glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see old 
						Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The bright 
						stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as it spilled on to his 
						fingers and head, and dripped, dripped, in hundreds of silver drops on to his 
						feet.
						<BR>
					<P align="justify">
					[14] LOTR. Treebeard.
					<P align="justify">'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a 
						place, it is a gathering of Ents – which does not often happen nowadays. But I 
						have managed to make a fair number promise to come. We shall meet in the place 
						where we have always met: Derndingle Men call it. It is away south from here. 
						We must be there before noon.'
						<BR>
						Before long they set off. Treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the 
						previous day. At the entrance to the court he turned to the right, stepped over 
						the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes 
						where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and 
						rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. Soon Treebeard turned a little 
						away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, 
						taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. For a while 
						they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first 
						ventured into Fangorn, but it soon passed. Treebeard did not talk to them. He 
						hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but Merry and Pippin caught no 
						proper words: it sounded like boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar 
						boom boom, dahrar boom, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. 
						Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, 
						that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or 
						perhaps from the boles of the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his 
						head to either side.
						<BR>
						They had been going for a long while – Pippin had tried to keep count of the 
						'ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand – when 
						Treebeard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he stopped, put the hobbits down, 
						and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube; then 
						he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out like a deep-throated 
						horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. Far off there came from 
						several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that was not an echo but an 
						answer.
						<BR>
						Treebeard now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, 
						every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers 
						came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an 
						impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had 
						never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely 
						clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff 
						upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.
						<BR>
						Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge Treebeard came in a few 
						strides to a narrow entrance. Through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly 
						down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending into a great 
						dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned at the rim with 
						the high dark evergreen hedge. It was smooth and grassclad inside, and there 
						were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at 
						the bottom of the bowl. Two other paths led down into the dingle: from the west 
						and from the east.
						<BR>
						Several Ents had already arrived. More were coming in down the other paths, and 
						some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits gazed at them. 
						They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like Treebeard as one 
						hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); and they were very 
						much surprised to see nothing of the kind. The Ents were as different from one 
						another as trees from trees: some as different as one tree is from another of 
						the same name but quite different growth and history; and some as different as 
						one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech; oak from fir. There were a few 
						older Ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked 
						as ancient as Treebeard); and there were tall strong Ents, clean-limbed and 
						smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young Ents, 
						no saplings. Altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy 
						floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in.
						<BR>
						At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the 
						many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of 
						leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to 
						nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded them of 
						beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the chestnut: 
						brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some 
						recalled the ash: tall straight grey Ents with many-fingered hands and long 
						legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, the rowan, and the 
						linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Treebeard, bowing their heads 
						slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices, and looking long and intently 
						at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, 
						and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as Treebeard's, but all 
						with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.
						<BR>
						As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round 
						Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. The Ents began to 
						murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting 
						together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the 
						ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side. Though 
						he could not catch or understand any of the words – he supposed the language 
						was Entish – Pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first; but 
						gradually his attention wavered. After a long time (and the chant showed no 
						signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, since Entish was such an 
						'unhasty' language, whether they had yet got further than Good Morning; and if 
						Treebeard was to call the roll, how many days it would take to sing all their 
						names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for yes or no,' he thought. He yawned.
						<BR>
						Treebeard was immediately aware of him. 'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!' he said, and 
						the other Ents all stopped their chant. 'You are a hasty folk, I was 
						forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not 
						understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, and 
						they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Orcs, and that a new 
						line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that is 
						quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry can stroll about in the dingle, if you 
						like. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the 
						north bank. There are still some words to speak before the Moot really begins. 
						I will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going.'
						<BR>
						He put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed low. This feat 
						seemed to amuse the Ents very much, to judge by the tone of their murmurs, and 
						the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. 
						Merry and Pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked 
						through the opening in the great hedge. Long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip 
						of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge 
						there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. Southwards to their 
						left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance. There 
						far away there was a pale green glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of 
						the plains of Rohan.
						<BR>
						'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin.
						<BR>
						'I don't know quite where we are,' said Merry; 'but that peak is probably 
						Methedras, and as far as I can remember the ring of Isengard lies in a fork or 
						deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably down behind this great 
						ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left of the peak, don't 
						you think?'
						<BR>
						'What is Isengard like?' said Pippin. 'I wonder what Ents can do about it 
						anyway.'
						<BR>
						'So do I,' said Merry. 'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills, I think, 
						with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle, called 
						Orthanc. Saruman has a tower on it. There is a gate, perhaps more than one, in 
						the encircling wall, and I believe there is a stream running through it; it 
						comes out of the mountains, and flows on across the Gap of Rohan. It does not 
						seem the sort of place for Ents to tackle. But I have an odd feeling about 
						these Ents: somehow I don't think they are quite as safe and, well funny as 
						they seem. They seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet I believe 
						they could be roused. If that happened, I would rather not be on the other 
						side.'
						<BR>
						'Yes!' said Pippin. 'I know what you mean. There might be all the difference 
						between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull charging; and 
						the change might come suddenly. I wonder if Treebeard will rouse them. I am 
						sure he means to try. But they don't like being roused. Treebeard got roused 
						himself last night, and then bottled it up again.'
						<BR>
						The hobbits turned back. The voices of the Ents were still rising and falling 
						in their conclave. The sun had now risen high enough to look over the high 
						hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward side of the 
						dingle with a cool yellow light. There they saw a little glittering fountain. 
						They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens-it 
						was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, and not to be in a 
						hurry-and then they climbed down to the gushing water. They drank a little, a 
						clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy stone, watching the patches 
						of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the 
						floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents went on. It seemed a very strange 
						and remote place, outside their world, and far from everything that had ever 
						happened to them. A great longing came over them for the faces and voices of 
						their companions, especially for Frodo and Sam, and for Strider.
						<BR>
						At last there came a pause in the Ent-voices; and looking up they saw Treebeard 
						coming towards them. with another Ent at his side.
						<BR>
						'Hm, hoom, here I am again,' said Treebeard. 'Are you getting weary, or feeling 
						impatient, hmm, eh? Well, I am afraid that you must not get impatient yet. We 
						have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to explain things again 
						to those that live a long way off, far from Isengard, and those that I could 
						not get round to before the Moot, and after that we shall have to decide what 
						to do. However, deciding what to do does not take Ents so long as going over 
						all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about. Still, it 
						is no use denying, we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of days very 
						likely. So I have brought you a companion. He has an ent-house nearby. Bregalad 
						is his Elvish name. He says he has already made up his mind and does not need 
						to remain at the Moot. Hm, hm, he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent. 
						You ought to get on together. Good-bye!' Treebeard turned and left them.
						<BR>
						Bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they looked at 
						him, wondering when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. He was tall, and 
						seemed to be one of the younger Ents; he had smooth shining skin on his arms 
						and legs; his lips were ruddy, and his hair was grey-green. He could bend and 
						sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last he spoke, and his voice though 
						resonant was higher and clearer than Treebeard's.
						<BR>
						'Ha, hmm, my friends, let us go for a walk!' he said. 'I am Bregalad, that is 
						Quickbeam in your language. But it is only a nickname, of course. They have 
						called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent before he had finished his 
						question. Also I drink quickly, and go out while some are still wetting their 
						beards. Come with me!'
						<BR>
						He reached down two shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand to each of the 
						hobbits. All that day they walked about in the woods with him, singing, and 
						laughing; for Quickbeam often laughed. He laughed if the sun came out from 
						behind a cloud, he laughed if they came upon a stream or spring: then he 
						stooped and splashed his feet and head with water; he laughed sometimes at some 
						sound or whisper in the trees. Whenever he saw a rowan-tree he halted a while 
						with his arms stretched out, and sang, and swayed as he sang.
						<BR>
						At nightfall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than a mossy stone 
						set upon turves under a green bank. Rowan-trees grew in a circle about it, and 
						there was water (as in all ent-houses), a spring bubbling out from the bank. 
						They talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. Not far away the voices 
						of the Entmoot could be heard still going on; but now they seemed deeper and 
						less leisurely, and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high 
						and quickening music, while all the others died away. But beside them Bregalad 
						spoke gently in their own tongue, almost whispering; and they learned that he 
						belonged to Skinbark's people, and the country where they had lived had been 
						ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his 'hastiness', at 
						least in the matter of Orcs.
						<BR>
						'There were rowan-trees in my home,' said Bregalad, softly and sadly, 
						'rowan-trees that took root when I was an Enting, many many years ago in the 
						quiet of the world. The oldest were planted by the Ents to try and please the 
						Entwives; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where 
						whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. Yet there are no trees of all 
						that race, the people of the Rose, that are so beautiful to me. And these trees 
						grew and grew, till the shadow of each was like a green hall, and their red 
						berries in the autumn were a burden, and a beauty and a wonder. Birds used to 
						flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and the rowan has enough and 
						to spare. But the birds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at the trees, and 
						threw the fruit down and did not eat it. Then Orcs came with axes and cut down 
						my trees. I came and called them by their long names, but they did not quiver, 
						they did not hear or answer: they lay dead.
						<BR>
						O Orofarne, Lassemista, Carnimirie!
						<BR>
						O rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay!
						<BR>
						O rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer's day,
						<BR>
						Your rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft:
						<BR>
						Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft!
						<BR>
						O rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey;
						<BR>
						Your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day.
						<BR>
						O Orofarne, Lassemista, Carnimirie!
						<BR>
						The hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of Bregalad, that 
						seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved.
						<BR>
						The next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go far from his 
						'house'. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank; for 
						the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was little 
						sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the Ents at the Moot still rose and 
						fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, sometimes quickening, 
						sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. A second night came and still the Ents 
						held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars.
						<BR>
						The third day broke, bleak and windy. At sunrise the Ents' voices rose to a 
						great clamour and then died down again. As the morning wore on the wind fell 
						and the air grew heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could see that Bregalad was 
						now listening intently, although to them, down in the dell of his ent-house, 
						the sound of the Moot was faint.
						<BR>
						The afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains, sent out 
						long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds. Suddenly they 
						were aware that everything was very quiet; the whole forest stood in listening 
						silence. Of course, the Ent-voices had stopped. What did that mean? Bregalad 
						was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards towards Derndingle.
						<BR>
						Then with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah! The trees quivered 
						and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and then a 
						marching music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats and booms 
						there welled voices singing high and strong.
						<BR>
						We come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!
						<BR>
						The Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:
						<BR>
						We come, we come with horn and drum: ta-r&#363;na r&#363;na r&#363;na rom!
						<BR>
						Bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.
						<BR>
						Before long they saw the marching line approaching: the Ents were swinging 
						along with great strides down the slope towards them. Treebeard was at their 
						head, and some fifty followers were behind him, two abreast, keeping step with 
						their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks. As they drew 
						near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen.
						<BR>
						'Hoom, hom! Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!' called Treebeard 
						when he caught sight of Bregalad and the hobbits. 'Come, join the Moot! We are 
						off. We are off to Isengard!'
						<BR>
						'To Isengard!' the Ents cried in many voices.
						<BR>
						'To Isengard!'
						<BR>
						To Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;
						<BR>
						Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,
						<BR>
						We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;
						<BR>
						For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars – we go to war!
						<BR>
						To land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;
						<BR>
						To Isengard with doom we come!
						<BR>
						With doom we come, with doom we come!
						<BR>
						So they sang as they marched southwards.
						<BR>
						Bregalad, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside Treebeard. The old Ent 
						now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and so they 
						rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads 
						held high. Though they had expected something to happen eventually, they were 
						amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as sudden as 
						the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike.
						<BR>
						'The Ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?' Pippin 
						ventured to say after some time, when for a moment the singing paused, and only 
						the beating of hands and feet was heard.
						<BR>
						'Quickly?' said Treebeard. 'Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. Indeed 
						I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not like 
						being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our trees 
						and our lives are in great danger. That has not happened in this Forest since 
						the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea. It is the orc-work, the wanton 
						hewing – rarum – without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires, that has so 
						angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should have helped us. 
						Wizards ought to know better: they do know better. There is no curse in Elvish, 
						Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such treachery. Down with 
						Saruman!'
						<BR>
						'Will you really break the doors of Isengard?' asked Merry.
						<BR>
						'Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps, how strong we are. 
						Maybe you have heard of Trolls? They are mighty strong. But Trolls are only 
						counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the Great Darkness, in mockery of Ents, as 
						Orcs were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls. We are made of the bones of 
						the earth. We can split stone like the roots of trees, only quicker, far 
						quicker, if our minds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire 
						or blast of sorcery, we could split Isengard into splinters and crack its walls 
						into rubble.'
						<BR>
						'But Saruman will try to stop you, won't he?'
						<BR>
						'Hm, ah, yes, that is so. I have not forgotten it. Indeed I have thought long 
						about it. But, you see, many of the Ents are younger than I am, by many lives 
						of trees. They are all roused now, and their mind is all on one thing: breaking 
						Isengard. But they will start thinking again before long; they will cool down a 
						little, when we take our evening drink. What a thirst we shall have! But let 
						them march now and sing! We have a long way to go, and there is time ahead for 
						thought. It is something to have started.'
						<BR>
						Treebeard marched on, singing with the others for a while. But after a time his 
						voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin could see that his old 
						brow was wrinkled and knotted. At last he looked up, and Pippin could see a sad 
						look in his eyes, sad but not unhappy. There was a light in them, as if the 
						green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought.
						<BR>
						'Of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely enough 
						that we are going to our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we stayed at 
						home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. That thought 
						has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are marching now. It 
						was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the Ents may be worth a 
						song. Aye,' he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples before we pass away. 
						Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true about the Entwives. I 
						should dearly have liked to see Fimbrethil again. But there, my friends, songs 
						like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes 
						they are withered untimely.'
						<BR>
						The Ents went striding on at a great pace. They had descended into a long fold 
						of the land that fell away southward; now they began to climb up, and up, on to 
						the high western ridge. The woods fell away and they came to scattered groups 
						of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew. The 
						sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. Grey dusk fell.
						<BR>
						Pippin looked behind. The number of the Ents had grown – or what was happening? 
						Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought he saw 
						groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the trees of Fangorn 
						were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the hills to war? He 
						rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great 
						grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like wind in many 
						branches. The Ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now, and all song 
						had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a 
						faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the Ents, and a rustle, the shade 
						of a whisper as of many drifting leaves. At last they stood upon the summit, 
						and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of the mountains: 
						Nan Curunir, the Valley of Saruman.
						<BR>
						'Night lies over Isengard,' said Treebeard.

					<P align="justify">'But the hobbits!' Legolas broke in. 'We have come far to seek 
						them, and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?'
						<BR>
						'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.
						<BR>
						'The Ents!' exclaimed Aragorn. 'Then there is truth in the old legends about 
						the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? Are 
						there still Ents in the world? I thought they were only a memory of ancient 
						days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.'
						<BR>
						'A legend of Rohan!' cried Legolas. 'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has sung 
						songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even among us they are only 
						a memory. If I were to meet one still walking in this world, then indeed I 
						should feel young again! But Treebeard: that is only a rendering of Fangorn 
						into the Common Speech; yet you seem to speak of a person. Who is this 
						Treebeard?'
						<BR>
						'Ah! now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of his 
						long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. Treebeard is 
						Fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the Ents, the oldest 
						living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth. I hope 
						indeed, Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and Pippin have been 
						fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he came here two days ago 
						and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. He 
						often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world 
						outside trouble him. I saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and I 
						think he saw me, for he paused; but I did not speak, for I was heavy with 
						thought, and weary after my struggle with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not 
						speak either, nor call my name.'
						<BR>
						'Perhaps he also thought that you were Saruman,' said Gimli. 'But you speak of 
						him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.'
						<BR>
						'Dangerous!' cried Gandalf. 'And so am I, very dangerous: more dangerous than 
						anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of 
						the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas is dangerous. You are 
						beset with dangers, Gimli son of Gloin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your 
						own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is perilous – not least to those 
						that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn himself, he is perilous too; 
						yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now his long slow wrath is brimming 
						over, and all the forest is filled with it. The coming of the hobbits and the 
						tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be running like a 
						flood; but its tide is turned against Saruman and the axes of Isengard. A thing 
						is about to happen which has not happened since the Elder Days: the Ents are 
						going to wake up and find that they are strong.'
						<BR>
						'What will they do?' asked Legolas in astonishment.

						'I do not know,' said Gandalf. 'I do not think they know themselves. I wonder.'

					<P align="justify">Even as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees three 
						strange shapes. As tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; 
						their strong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or 
						with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long, and their 
						hands had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as 
						moss. They gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the riders: 
						their eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly they lifted their long hands to their 
						mouths, and sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes of a horn, but more 
						musical and various. The calls were answered; and turning again, the riders saw 
						other creatures of the same kind approaching, striding through the grass. They 
						came swiftly from the North, walking like wading herons in their gait, but not 
						in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the 
						heron's wings. The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some set their hands upon 
						their sword-hilts.
						<BR>
						'You need no weapons,' said Gandalf. 'These are but herdsmen. They are not 
						enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.'
						<BR>
						So it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a glance at the 
						riders, strode into the wood and vanished.

						'Herdsmen!' said Th&#233;oden. 'Where are their flocks? What are they, Gandalf? 
						For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.'

						'They are the shepherds of the trees,' answered Gandalf. 'Is it so long since 
						you listened to tales by the fireside? There are children in your land who, out 
						of the twisted threads of story, could pick the answer to your question. You 
						have seen Ents, O King, Ents out of Fangorn Forest, which in your tongue you 
						call the Entwood. Did you think that the name was given only in idle fancy? 
						Nay, Th&#233;oden, it is otherwise: to them you are but the passing tale; all 
						the years from Eorl the Young to Th&#233;oden the Old are of little count to 
						them; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter.'
						<BR>
						The king was silent. 'Ents!' he said at length. 'Out of the shadows of legend I 
						begin a little to understand the marvel of the trees, I think. I have lived to 
						see strange days. Long we have tended our beasts and our fields, built our 
						houses, wrought our tools, or ridden away to help in the wars of Minas Tirith. 
						And that we called the life of Men, the way of the world. We cared little for 
						what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we have that tell of these 
						things, but we are forgetting them, teaching them only to children, as a 
						careless custom. And now the songs have come down among us out of strange 
						places, and walk visible under the Sun.'
						<BR>
						(…)
						<BR>
						Where is Treebeard, Merry?'
						<BR>
						'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a drink-of clean water. Most 
						of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work – over there.' Merry 
						waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as they looked, they heard a 
						distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling from the 
						mountain-side. Far away came a hoom-hom, as of horns blowing triumphantly.
						<BR>
						'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?' asked Gandalf.
						<BR>
						'There is the water,' said Merry. 'But Quickbeam and some others are watching 
						it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of Saruman's planting. 
						Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.'
						<BR>
						'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,' said Legolas, 'but his arms are at his sides, 
						and he stands as still as a door-tree.'
						<BR>
						'It is past noon,' said Gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten since early 
						morning. Yet I wish to see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he leave me no 
						message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?'
						<BR>
						'He left a message,' said Merry, 'and I was coming to it, but I have been 
						hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the Lord of the Mark 
						and Gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find Treebeard there, and 
						he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of the best 
						there, it was discovered and selected by your humble servants.' He bowed.
						<BR>
						Gandalf laughed. 'That is better!' he said. 'Well, Th&#233;oden. will you ride 
						with me to find Treebeard? We must go round about, but it is not far. When you 
						see Treebeard, you will learn much. For Treebeard is Fangorn, and the eldest 
						and chief of the Ents, and when you speak with him you will hear the speech of 
						the oldest of all living things.'
						<BR>
						(…)
						<BR>
						- This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'
						<BR>
						'He has not,' said Merry. 'But Ents only drink, and drink is not enough for 
						content. Treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of 
						something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change.'
						<BR>
						'You have drunk of the waters of the Ents, have you?' said Legolas. 'Ah, then I 
						think it is likely that Gimli's eyes do not deceive him. Strange songs have 
						been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.'
						<BR>
						'Many strange tales have been told about that land,' said Aragorn. 'I have 
						never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the Ents!'
						<BR>
						'Ents,' said Pippin, 'Ents are – well Ents are all different for on thing. But 
						their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.'
						<BR>

					<P align="justify">'Let me see,' said Merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part 
						of the story you know nothing about. We met Treebeard that morning after the 
						battle; and that night we were at Wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. The next 
						morning we went to Entmoot, a gathering of Ents, that is, and the queerest 
						thing I have ever seen in my life. It lasted all that day and the next; and we 
						spent the nights with an Ent called Quickbeam. And then late in the afternoon 
						in the third day of their moot, the Ents suddenly blew up. It was amazing. The 
						Forest had felt as tense as if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it: then all 
						at once it exploded. I wish you could have heard their song as they marched.'
						<BR>
						'If Saruman had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by now, even if he 
						had had to run on his own legs,' said Pippin.
						<BR>
						'Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,
						<BR>
						We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door!
						<BR>
						There was very much more. A great deal of the song had no words, and was like a 
						music of horns and drums. It was very exciting. But I thought it was only 
						marching music and no more, just a song – until I got here. I know better now.'
						<BR>
						'We came down over the last ridge into Nan Curunir, after night had fallen,' 
						Merry continued. 'It was then that I first had the feeling that the Forest 
						itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming an entish dream, but 
						Pippin had noticed it too. We were both frightened; but we did not find out 
						more about it until later.
						<BR>
						'It was the Huorns, or so the Ents call them in "short language". Treebeard 
						won't say much about them, but I think they are Ents that have become almost 
						like trees, at least to look at. They stand here and there in the wood or under 
						its eaves, silent, watching endlessly over the trees; but deep in the darkest 
						dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them, I believe.
						<BR>
						'There is a great power in them, and they seem able to wrap themselves in 
						shadow: it is difficult to see them moving. But they do. They can move very 
						quickly, if they are angry. You stand still looking at the weather, maybe, or 
						listening to the rustling of the wind, and then suddenly you find that you are 
						in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around you. They still 
						have voices, and can speak with the Ents – that is why they are called Huorns, 
						Treebeard says – but they have become queer and wild. Dangerous. I should be 
						terrified of meeting them, if there were no true Ents about to look after them.
						<BR>
						'Well, in the early night we crept down a long ravine into the upper end of the 
						Wizard's Vale, the Ents with all their rustling Huorns behind. We could not see 
						them, of course, but the whole air was full of creaking. It was very dark, a 
						cloudy night. They moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills, 
						and made a noise like a rushing wind. The Moon did not appear through the 
						clouds, and not long after midnight there was a tall wood all round the north 
						side of Isengard. There was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge. There was 
						a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, that was all.
						<BR>
						'Treebeard and a few more Ents crept on, right round to within sight of the 
						great gates. Pippin and I were with him. We were sitting on Treebeard's 
						shoulders, and I could feel the quivering tenseness in him. But even when they 
						are roused, Ents can be very cautious and patient. They stood still as carved 
						stones, breathing and listening.
						<BR>
						'Then all at once there was a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared and the walls of 
						Isengard echoed. We thought that we had been discovered, and that battle was 
						going to begin. But nothing of the sort. All Saruman's people were marching 
						away. I don't know much about this war, or about the Horsemen of Rohan, but 
						Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one 
						final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless lines of marching 
						Orcs; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And there were battalions of 
						Men, too. Many of them carried torches, and in the flare I could see their 
						faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and dark-haired, and grim 
						but not particularly evil-looking. But there were some others that were 
						horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed. Do you 
						know, they reminded me at once of that Southerner at Bree: only he was not so 
						obviously orc-like as most of these were.'
						<BR>
						'I thought of him too,' said Aragorn. 'We had many of these half-orcs to deal 
						with at Helm's Deep. It seems plain now that that Southerner was a spy of 
						Saruman's; but whether he was working with the Black Riders, or for Saruman 
						alone, I do not know. It is difficult with these evil folk to know when they 
						are in league, and when they are cheating one another.'
						<BR>
						'Well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at the very 
						least,' said Merry. 'They took an hour to pass out of the gates. Some went off 
						down the highway to the Fords, and some turned away and went eastward. A bridge 
						has been built down there, about a mile away, where the river runs in a very 
						deep channel. You could see it now, if you stood up. They were all singing with 
						harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. I thought things looked very 
						black for Rohan. But Treebeard did not move. He said: 'My business is with 
						Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.'
						<BR>
						'But, though I could not see what was happening in the dark, I believe that 
						Huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. Their 
						business was with Orcs I think. They were far down the valley in the morning; 
						or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn't see through.
						<BR>
						'As soon as Saruman had sent off all his army, our turn came. Treebeard put us 
						down, and went up to the gates, and began hammering on the doors, and calling 
						for Saruman. There was no answer, except arrows and stones from the walls. But 
						arrows are no use against Ents. They hurt them, of course, and infuriate them: 
						like stinging flies. But an Ent can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a 
						pin-cushion, and take no serious harm. They cannot be poisoned, for one thing; 
						and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher than bark. It takes a very 
						heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They don't like axes. But there would 
						have to be a great many axe-men to one Ent: a man that hacks once at an Ent 
						never gets a chance of a second blow. A punch from an Ent-fist crumples up iron 
						like thin tin.
						<BR>
						'When Treebeard had got a few arrows in him, he began to warm up, to get 
						positively "hasty", as he would say. He let out a great hoom-hom, and a dozen 
						more Ents came striding up. An angry Ent is terrifying. Their fingers, and 
						their toes, just freeze on to rock; and they tear it up like bread-crust. It 
						was like watching the work of great tree-roots in a hundred years, all packed 
						into a few moments.
						<BR>
						'They pushed, pulled, tore, shook, and hammered; and clang-bang, crash-crack, 
						in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in ruin; and some were 
						already beginning to eat into the walls, like rabbits in a sand-pit. I don't 
						know what Saruman thought was happening; but anyway he did not know how to deal 
						with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately, of course; but anyway I 
						think he has not much grit, not much plain courage alone in a tight place 
						without a lot of slaves and machines and things, if you know what I mean. Very 
						different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame was not all along mainly due 
						to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.'
						<BR>
						'No,' said Aragorn. 'Once he was as great as his fame made him. His knowledge 
						was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvellously skilled; and he 
						had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could persuade, and the 
						smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still keeps. There are not 
						many in Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if they were left alone to 
						talk with him, even now when he has suffered a defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and 
						Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but very few 
						others.'
						<BR>
						'The Ents are safe,' said Pippin. 'He seems at one time to have got round them, 
						but never again. And anyway he did not understand them; and he made the great 
						mistake of leaving them out of his calculations. He had no plan for them, and 
						there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. As soon as our attack 
						began, the few remaining rats in Isengard started bolting through every hole 
						that the Ents made. The Ents let the Men go, after they had questioned them, 
						two or three dozen only down at this end. I don't think many orc-folk, of any 
						size, escaped. Not from the Huorns: there was a wood full of them all round 
						Isengard by that time, as well as those that had gone down the valley.
						<BR>
						'When the Ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to rubbish, and 
						what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him, Saruman fled in a 
						panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: I expect he came to 
						watch his splendid army march out. When the Ents broke their way in, he left in 
						a hurry. They did not spot him at first. But the night had opened out, and 
						there was a great light of stars, quite enough for Ents to see by, and suddenly 
						Quickbeam gave a cry "The tree-killer, the tree-killer!" Quickbeam is a gentle 
						creature, but he hates Saruman all the more fiercely for that: his people 
						suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He leapt down the path from the inner gate, and 
						he can move like a wind when he is roused. There was a pale figure hurrying 
						away in and out of the shadows of the pillars, and it had nearly reached the 
						stairs to the tower-door. But it was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after 
						him, that he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled when he 
						slipped in through the door.
						<BR>
						'When Saruman was safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before he set some of 
						his precious machinery to work. By that time there were many Ents inside 
						Isengard: some had followed Quickbeam, and others had burst in from the north 
						and east; they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage. Suddenly up 
						came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to 
						spout and belch. Several of the Ents got scorched and blistered. One of them, 
						Beechbone I think he was called, a very tall handsome Ent, got caught in a 
						spray of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a horrible sight.
						<BR>
						'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before; but I 
						was wrong. I saw what it was like at last. It was staggering. They roared and 
						boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of 
						them. Merry and I lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears. Round 
						and round the rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding and storming like a 
						howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts, 
						tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves. The tower was in the 
						middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go 
						rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash against the windows of Orthanc. But 
						Treebeard kept his head. He had not had any burns, luckily. He did not want his 
						folk to hurt themselves in their fury, and he did not want Saruman to escape 
						out of some hole in the confusion. Many of the Ents were hurling themselves 
						against the Orthanc-rock; but that defeated them. It is very smooth and hard. 
						Some wizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than Saruman's. Anyway they 
						could not get a grip on it, or make a crack in it; and they were bruising and 
						wounding themselves against it. 'So Treebeard went out into the ring and 
						shouted. His enormous voice rose above all the din. There was a dead silence, 
						suddenly. In it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower. That 
						had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now they became 
						cold, grim as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered round Treebeard, 
						standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little in their own language; I 
						think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his old head long before. 
						Then they just faded silently away in the grey light. Day was dawning by that 
						time.
						<BR>
						'They set a watch on the tower, I believe, but the watchers were so well hidden 
						in shadows and kept so still, that I could not see them. The others went away 
						north. All that day they were busy, out of sight. Most of the time we were left 
						alone. It was a dreary day; and we wandered about a bit, though we kept out of 
						the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we could: they stared at us so 
						threateningly. A good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat. 
						And also we sat and talked, wondering what was happening away south in Rohan, 
						and what had become of all the rest of our Company. Every now and then we could 
						hear in the distance the rattle and fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing 
						in the hills.
						<BR>
						'In the afternoon we walked round the circle, and went to have a look at what 
						was going on. There was a great shadowy wood of Huorns at the head of the 
						valley, and another round the northern wall. We did not dare to go in. But 
						there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and Huorns 
						were digging great pits and trenches, and making great pools and dams, 
						gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream that 
						they could find. We left them to it.
						<BR>
						'At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming and booming to 
						himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched his great arms and legs and 
						breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired.
						<BR>
						' "Tired?" he said, "tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a good 
						draught of Entwash. We have worked hard; we have done more stone-cracking and 
						earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long year before. But it is 
						nearly finished. When night falls do not linger near this gate or in the old 
						tunnel! Water may come through-and it will be foul water for a while, until all 
						the filth of Saruman is washed away. Then Isen can run clean again." He began 
						to pull down a bit more of the walls, in a leisurely sort of way, just to amuse 
						himself.
						<BR>
						'We were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep, when 
						the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a rider coming 
						swiftly up the road. Merry and I lay quiet, and Treebeard hid himself in the 
						shadows under the arch. Suddenly a great horse came striding up, like a flash 
						of silver. It was already dark. but I could see the rider's face clearly: it 
						seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat up, staring, with 
						my mouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn't.
						<BR>
						'There was no need. He halted just by us and looked down at us. 'Gandalf!' I 
						said at last. but my voice was only a whisper. Did he say: "Hullo, Pippin! This 
						is a pleasant surprise!"? No, indeed! He said: "Get up, you tom-fool of a Took! 
						Where, in the name of wonder, in all this ruin is Treebeard? I want him. 
						Quick!"
						<BR>
						'Treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once; and there was a 
						strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of them seemed surprised at 
						all. Gandalf obviously expected to find Treebeard here; and Treebeard might 
						almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him. Yet we 
						had told the old Ent all about Moria. But then I remembered a queer look he 
						gave us at the time. I can only suppose that he had seen Gandalf or had some 
						news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry. "Don't be hasty" is his 
						motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say much about Gandalf's movements when 
						he is not there.
						<BR>
						'"Hoom! Gandalf!" said Treebeard. "I am glad you have come. Wood and water, 
						stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard to manage here."
						<BR>
						'"Treebeard," said Gandalf. "I need your help. You have done much, but I need 
						more. I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage."
						<BR>
						'Then those two went off and had a council together in some corner. It must 
						have seemed very hasty to Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous hurry, and 
						was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hearing. They 
						were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour. Then Gandalf 
						came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He did say he was glad 
						to see us, then.
						<BR>
						'"But Gandalf," I cried, "where have you been? And have you seen the others?"
						<BR>
						'"Wherever I have been, I am back," he answered in the genuine Gandalf manner. 
						"Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news must wait. This is a perilous 
						night, and I must ride fast. But the dawn may be brighter; and if so, we shall 
						meet again. Take care of yourselves, and keep away from Orthanc! Good-bye!"
						<BR>
						'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone. He had evidently learnt 
						a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked at us and said: "Hm, 
						well, I find you are not such hasty folk as I thought. You said much less than 
						you might, and not more than you should. Hm, this is a bundle of news and no 
						mistake! Well, now Treebeard must get busy again."
						<BR>
						'Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer us up at 
						all. But for the moment we thought more about you three than about Frodo and 
						Sam, or about poor Boromir. For we gathered that there was a great battle going 
						on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never come out of it.
						<BR>
						'"Huorns will help," said Treebeard. Then he went away and we did not see him 
						again until this morning.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						'It was deep night. We lay on top of a pile of stone, and could see nothing 
						beyond it. Mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all 
						round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, 
						creakings, and a murmur like voices passing. I think that hundreds more of the 
						Huorns must have been passing by to help in the battle. Later there was a great 
						rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lightning far away across Rohan. 
						Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out 
						suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises 
						like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed.
						<BR>
						'It must have been about midnight when the Ents broke the dams and poured all 
						the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall, down into Isengard. The 
						Huorn-dark had passed, and the thunder had rolled away. The Moon was sinking 
						behind the western mountains.
						<BR>
						'Isengard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. They 
						glittered in the last light of the Moon, as they spread over the plain. Every 
						now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or spouthole. 
						Great white steams hissed up. Smoke rose in billows. There were explosions and 
						gusts of fire. One great coil of vapour went whirling up, twisting round and 
						round Orthanc, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and 
						moonlit above. And still more water poured in, until at last Isengard looked 
						like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.'
						<BR>
						'We saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to 
						the mouth of Nan Curunir,' said Aragorn. 'We feared that Saruman was brewing 
						some new devilry for us.'
						<BR>
						'Not he!' said Pippin. 'He was probably choking and not laughing any more. By 
						the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and 
						there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had 
						rather a fright. The lake began to overflow and pour out through the old 
						tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. We thought we were going 
						to get caught like Orcs in a hole; but we found a winding stair at the back of 
						the store-room that brought us out on top of the arch. It was a squeeze to get 
						out, as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near 
						the top. There we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of 
						Isengard. The Ents kept on pouring in more water, till all the fires were 
						quenched and every cave filled. The fogs slowly gathered together and steamed 
						up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it must have been a mile high. In the evening 
						there was a great rainbow over the eastern hills; and then the sunset was 
						blotted out by a thick drizzle on the mountain-sides. It all went very quiet. A 
						few wolves howled mournfully, far away. The Ents stopped the inflow in the 
						night, and sent the Isen back into its old course. And that was the end of it 
						all.
						<BR>
						'Since then the water has been sinking again. There must be outlets somewhere 
						from the caves underneath, I think. If Saruman peeps out of any of his windows, 
						it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We felt very lonely. Not even a visible 
						Ent to talk to in all the ruin; and no news. We spent the night up on top there 
						above the arch, and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep. We had a feeling 
						that anything might happen at any minute. Saruman is still in his tower. There 
						was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley. I think the Ents and 
						Huorns that had been away came back then; but where they have all gone to now, 
						I don't know. It was a misty, moisty morning when we climbed down and looked 
						round again, and nobody was about. And that is about all there is to tell. It 
						seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil. And safer too, somehow, since 
						Gandalf came back. I could sleep!'
						<BR>
						They all fell silent for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. 'There is one thing 
						I wonder about,' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: 'Wormtongue. 
						You told Theoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?'
						<BR>
						'Oh yes, I forgot about him,' said Pippin. 'He did not get here till this 
						morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard 
						appeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our names outside.
						<BR>
						'"I have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,' he said; 'and to 
						give you some news. Huorns have come back. All's well; aye very well indeed!" 
						he laughed, and slapped his thighs. "No more Orcs in Isengard, no more axes! 
						And there will be folk coming up from the South before the day is old; some 
						that you may be glad to see."
						<BR>
						'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. We 
						rushed out before the gates, and I stood and stared, half expecting to see 
						Strider and Gandalf come riding up at the head of an army. But out of the mist 
						there rode a man on an old tired horse; and he looked a queer twisted sort of 
						creature himself. There was no one else. When he came. out of the mist and 
						suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he sat and gaped, and 
						his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice 
						us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to turn his horse round and 
						ride off. But Treebeard took three strides, put out a long arm, and lifted him 
						out of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror, and he grovelled on the ground. 
						He said he was Grima, friend and counsellor of the king, and had been sent with 
						important messages from Theoden to Saruman.
						<BR>
						'"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul Orcs," 
						he said, "so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am hungry and 
						weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves."
						<BR>
						'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself "liar". 
						Treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes, till the 
						wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: "Ha, hm, I was 
						expecting you, Master Wormtongue." The man started at that name. "Gandalf got 
						here first. So I know as much about you as I need, and I know what to do with 
						you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will. I am the master of 
						Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you can go there and give 
						him all the messages that you can think of."
						<BR>
						'"Let me go, let me go!" said Wormtongue. "I know the way."
						<BR>
						'"You knew the way, I don't doubt," said Treebeard. "But things have changed 
						here a little. Go and see!"
						<BR>
						'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close behind, 
						until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay between him 
						and Orthanc. Then he turned to us.
						<BR>
						'"Let me go away!" he whined. "Let me go away! My messages are useless now."
						<BR>
						'"They are indeed," said Treebeard. "But you have only two choices: to stay 
						with me until Gandalf and your master arrive; or to cross the water. Which will 
						you have?"
						<BR>
						'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the water; 
						but he drew back. "I cannot swim," he said.
						<BR>
						'"The water is not deep," said Treebeard. "It is dirty, but that will not harm 
						you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!"
						<BR>
						'With that the wretch floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly to his 
						neck before he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of him was 
						clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood. But Treebeard waded after him, 
						and watched his progress.
						<BR>
						'"Well, he has gone in," he said when he returned. "I saw him crawling up the 
						steps like a draggled rat. There is someone in the tower still: a hand came out 
						and pulled him in. So there he is, and I hope the welcome is to his liking. Now 
						I must go and wash myself clean of the slime. I'll be away up on the north 
						side, if anyone wants to see me. There is no clean water down here fit for an 
						Ent to drink, or to bathe in. So I will ask you two lads to keep a watch at the 
						gate for the folk that are coming. There'll be the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, 
						mark you! You must welcome him as well as you know how: his men have fought a 
						great fight with the Orcs. Maybe, you know the right fashion of Men's words for 
						such a lord, better than Ents. There have been many lords in the green fields 
						in my time, and I have never learned their speech or their names. They will be 
						wanting man-food, and you know all about that, I guess. So find what you think 
						is fit for a king to eat, if you can." And that is the end of the story. Though 
						I should like to know who this Wormtongue is. Was he really the king's 
						counsellor?'
						<BR>
						'He was,' said Aragorn; 'and also Saruman's spy and servant in Rohan. Fate has 
						not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the ruin of all that he 
						thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. But 
						I fear that worse awaits him.'
						<BR>
						'Yes, I don't suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of kindness,' said 
						Merry. 'He seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to 
						himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. We spent a busy time after 
						that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found two or three 
						store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. But Treebeard 
						sent some Ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the stuff.
						<BR>
						'"We want man-food for twenty-five," the Ents said, so you can see that 
						somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived. You three were 
						evidently meant to go with the great people. But you would not have fared any 
						better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because we sent no 
						drink.
						<BR>
						'"What about drink?" I said to the Ents.
						<BR>
						'"There is water of Isen," they said, "and that is good enough for Ents and 
						Men." But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their 
						draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling 
						when he returns.

					<P align="justify">They returned now to the ruins of the gate. Hardly had they 
						passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones 
						where they had stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. 
						Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas gazed at them in wonder.
						<BR>
						'Here are three of my companions, Treebeard,' said Gandalf. 'I have spoken of 
						them, but you have not yet seen them.' He named them one by one.
						<BR>
						The Old Ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. 
						Last he turned to Legolas. 'So you have come all the way from Mirkwood, my good 
						Elf? A very great forest it used to be!'
						<BR>
						'And still is,' said Legolas. 'But not so great that we who dwell there ever 
						tire of seeing new trees. I should dearly love to journey in Fangorn's Wood. I 
						scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and I did not wish to turn back.'
						<BR>
						Treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'I hope you may have your wish, ere the 
						hills be much older,' he said.
						<BR>
						'I will come, if I have the fortune,' said Legolas. 'I have made a bargain with 
						my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit Fangorn together – by your 
						leave.'
						<BR>
						'Any Elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said Treebeard.
						<BR>
						'The friend I speak of is not an Elf,' said Legolas; 'I mean Gimli, Gloin's son 
						here.' Gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the 
						ground.
						<BR>
						'Hoom, hm! Ah now,' said Treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'A dwarf and an 
						axe-bearer! Hoom! I have good will to Elves; but you ask much. This is a 
						strange friendship!' 'Strange it may seem,' said Legolas; 'but while Gimli 
						lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but for 
						orc-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn's Wood. Forty-two he hewed in the 
						battle.'
						<BR>
						'Hoo! Come now!' said Treebeard. 'That is a better story! Well, well, things 
						will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But now we 
						must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you must go 
						ere nightfall, and the Lord of the Mark is eager for his own house.'
						<BR>
						'Yes, we must go, and go now,' said Gandalf. 'I fear that I must take your 
						gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.'
						<BR>
						'Maybe I shall,' said Treebeard. 'But I shall miss them. We have become friends 
						in so short a while that I think I must be getting hasty – growing backwards 
						towards youth, perhaps. But there, they are the first new thing under Sun or 
						Moon that I have seen for many a long, long day. I shall not forget them. I 
						have put their names into the Long List. Ents will remember it.
						<BR>
						Ents the earthborn, old as mountains,
						<BR>
						the wide-walkers, water drinking;
						<BR>
						and hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children,
						<BR>
						the laughing-folk, the little people,
						<BR>
						they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. Fare you well! But if 
						you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the Shire, send me word! You know 
						what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if you can!'
						<BR>
						'We will!' said Merry and Pippin together, and they turned away hastily. 
						Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head 
						thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf.
						<BR>
						'So Saruman would not leave?' he said. 'I did not think he would. His heart is 
						as rotten as a black Huorn's. Still, if I were overcome and all my trees 
						destroyed, I would not come while I had one dark hole left to hide in.'
						<BR>
						'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you have not plotted to cover all the world with your 
						trees and choke all other living things. But there it is, Saruman remains to 
						nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can. He has the Key of 
						Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape.'
						<BR>
						'Indeed no! Ents will see to that,' said Treebeard. 'Saruman shall not set foot 
						beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him.'
						<BR>
						'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped. Now I can go and turn to other 
						matters with one care the less. But you must be wary. The waters have gone 
						down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I do not 
						doubt that there were deep ways delved under Orthanc, and that Saruman hopes to 
						go and come unmarked, before long. If you will undertake the labour, I beg you 
						to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard remains a standing pool, 
						or you discover the outlets. When all the underground places are drowned, and 
						the outlets blocked, then Saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the 
						windows.'
						<BR>
						'Leave it to the Ents!' said Treebeard. 'We shall search the valley from head 
						to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live here, old 
						trees, wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel will go here, 
						but I shall know of it. Leave it to Ents! Until seven times the years in which 
						he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of watching him.'

					<P align="justify">Ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their 
						long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. Merry and Pippin looked back, when 
						they had passed some way down the winding road. Sunlight was still shining in 
						the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey ruins falling into 
						darkness. Treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old 
						tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away 
						on the borders of Fangorn.
						<BR>
						They came to the pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was still standing, but 
						the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces. Right in the 
						middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in the dusk, its red nail 
						darkening to black.
						<BR>
						'The Ents pay attention to every detail!' said Gandalf.

					<P align="justify">But amidst all these wonders he /Sam/ returned always to his

						back with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head. ‘Can’t understand it at 
						your age!’ he said. ‘But there it is: you’re three inches taller than you ought 
						to he, or I’m a dwarf.’
						<BR>
						‘That you certainly are not,’ said Gimli. ‘But what did I say? Mortals cannot 
						go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of 
						beer.’
						<BR>
						‘Ent-draughts?’ said Sam. ‘There you go about Ents again; but what they are

					<P align="justify">From Deeping-coomb they rode to Isengard, and saw how the Ents 
						had busied themselves. All the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed, 
						and the land within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees, and 
						a stream ran through it; but in the midst of all there was a lake of clear 
						water, and out of it the Tower of Orthanc rose still, tall and impregnable, and 
						its black rock was mirrored in the pool.
						<BR>
						For a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of Isengard had stood, 
						and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a 
						green-bordered path that ran towards Orthanc; and they looked in wonder at the 
						work that had been done, but no living thing could they see far or near. But 
						presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom, hoom-hom; and there came 
						Treebeard striding down the path to greet them with Quickbeam at his side.
						<BR>
						‘Welcome to the Treegarth of Orthanc!’ he said. ‘I knew that you were coming, 
						but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to be done. But you have 
						not been idle either away in the south and the east, I hear; and all that I 
						hear is good, very good.’ Then Treebeard praised all their deeds, of which he 
						seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked long at 
						Gandalf.
						<BR>
						‘Well, come now!’ he said. ‘You have proved mightiest, and all your labours 
						have gone well. Where now would you be going? And why do you come here?’
						<BR>
						‘To see how your work goes, my friend,’ said Gandalf, ‘and to thank you for 
						your aid in all that has been achieved.’
						<BR>
						‘Hoom, well, that is fair enough,’ said Treebeard; ‘for to be sure Ents have 
						played their part. And not only in dealing with that, hoom, that accursed 
						tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great inrush of those, burarum, 
						those evileyed - blackhanded - bowlegged - flinthearted - clawfingered - 
						foulbellied - bloodthirsty, morimaite - sincahonda, hoom, well, since you are 
						hasty folk and their full name is as long as years of torment, those vermin of 
						orcs; and they came over the River and down from the North and all round the 
						wood of Laurelindorenan, which they could not get into, thanks to the Great 
						ones who are here.’ He bowed to the Lord and Lady of Lorien.
						<BR>
						‘And these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out on the 
						Wold, for they had not heard of us before; though that might be said also of 
						better folk. And not many will remember us, for not many escaped us alive, and 
						the River had most of those. But it was well for you, for if they had not met 
						us, then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far, and if he had 
						there would have been no home to return to.’
						<BR>
						‘We know it well,’ said Aragorn, ‘and never shall it be forgotten in Minas 
						Tirith or in Edoras.’
						<BR>
						‘Never is too long a word even for me,’ said Treebeard. ‘Not while your 
						kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long to 
						Ents.’
						<BR>
						‘The New Age begins,’ said Gandalf, ‘and in this age it may well prove that the 
						kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangorn my friend. But now come tell me: 
						what of the task that I set you? How is Saruman? Is he not weary of Orthanc 
						yet? For I do not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from 
						his windows.’
						<BR>
						Treebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought. ‘Ah!’ 
						he said. ‘I thought you would come to that. Weary of Orthanc? Very weary at 
						last; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice. Hoom! I gave 
						him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in your speech.’
						<BR>
						‘Then why did he stay to listen? Did you go into Orthanc?’ asked Gandalf.
						<BR>
						‘Hoom, no, not into Orthanc!’ said Treebeard. ‘But he came to his window and 
						listened, because he could not get news in any other way, and though he hated 
						the news, he was greedy to have it; and I saw that he heard it all. But I added 
						a great many things to the news that it was good for him to think of. He grew 
						very weary. He always was hasty. That was his ruin.’
						<BR>
						‘l observe, my good Fangorn,’ said Gandalf, ‘that with great care you say 
						dwelt, was, grew. What about is? Is he dead?’
						<BR>
						‘No, not dead, so far as I know,’ said Treebeard. ‘But he is gone. Yes, he is 
						gone seven days. I let him go. There was little left of him when he crawled 
						out, and as for that worm-creature of his, he was like a pale shadow. Now do 
						not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I know it. But 
						things have changed since then. And I kept him until he was safe, safe from 
						doing any more harm. You should know that above all I hate the caging of live 
						things, and I will not keep even such creatures as these caged beyond great 
						need. A snake without fangs may crawl where he will.’
						<BR>
						‘You may be right,’ said Gandalf; ‘but this snake had still one tooth left, I 
						think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that he persuaded you, even 
						you Treebeard, knowing the soft spot in your heart. Well, he is gone, and there 
						is no more to be said. But the Tower of Orthanc now goes back to the King, to 
						whom it belongs. Though maybe he will not need it.’
						<BR>
						‘That will be seen later,’ said Aragorn. ‘But I will give to Ents all this 
						valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon Orthanc and 
						see that none enter it without my leave.’
						<BR>
						‘It is locked,’ said Treebeard. ‘I made Saruman lock it and give me the keys. 
						Quickbeam has them.’
						<BR>
						Quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to Aragorn two great 
						black keys of intricate shape, joined by a ring of steel. ‘Now I thank you once 
						more,’ said Aragorn, ‘and I bid you farewell. May your forest grow again in 
						peace. When this valley is filled there is room and to spare west of the 
						mountains, where once you walked long ago.’
						<BR>
						Treebeard’s face became sad. ‘Forests may grow,’ he said. ‘Woods may spread. 
						But not Ents. There are no Entings.’
						<BR>
						‘Yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,’ said Aragorn. ‘Lands will 
						lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.’
						<BR>
						But Treebeard shook his head and said: ‘It is far to go. And there are too many 
						Men there in these days. But I am forgetting my manners! Will you stay here and 
						rest a while? And maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through 
						Fangorn Forest and so shorten their road home?’ He looked at Celeborn and 
						Galadriel.
						<BR>
						But all save Legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart, 
						either south or west. ‘Come, Gimli!’ said Legolas. ‘Now by Fangorn’s leave I 
						will visit the deep places of the Entwood and see such trees as are nowhere 
						else to be found in Middle-earth. You shall come with me and keep your word; 
						and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in Mirkwood and beyond.’ 
						To this Gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.
						<BR>
						(…)
						<BR>
						Then Treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed three times 
						slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and Galadriel. ‘It is long, long 
						since we met by stock or by stone, A vanimar, vanimalion nostari!’ he said. ‘It 
						is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. For the world is changing: 
						I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, and I smell it in the air. I do 
						not think we shall meet again.’
						<BR>
						And Celeborn said: ‘I do not know, Eldest.’ But Galadriel said: ‘Not in 
						Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. 
						Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the Spring. Farewell!’
						<BR>
						Last of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the old Ent, and he grew gayer as 
						he looked at them. ‘Well, my merry folk,’ he said, ‘will you drink another 
						draught with me before you go?’
						<BR>
						‘Indeed we will,’ they said, and he took them aside into the shade of one of 
						the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set. And 
						Treebeard filled three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange eyes 
						looking at them over the rim of his bowl. ‘Take care take care!’ he said. ‘For 
						you have already grown since I saw you last.’ And they laughed and drained 
						their bowls.
						<BR>
						‘Well, good-bye!’ he said. ‘And don’t forget that if you hear any news of the 
						Entwives in your land, you will send word to me.’ Then he waved his great hands 
						to all the company and went off into the trees.

					I have long ceased to invent ...: I wait till I seem to know what really

						Treebeard is anxious for news. He never hears much. But he smells things in the

						The word Ents added in ink to the note on the difference between 'trolls' and

					In the fair copy this was greatly expanded, but by no means to the text of TT. 
					Here Treebeard begins as in the original draft (with Mountains of Lune for 
					Lune) as far as 'this was just the East End', but then continues:
					<P align="justify">'... Things went wrong there in the Dark [&gt; Elder] Days; some 
						old sorcery, I expect [) some old shadow of the Great Dark lay there]. They say 
						that even the Men that came out of the Sea were caught in it, and some of them 
						fell into the Shadow. But that is only a rumour to me. Anyway they have no 
						treeherds there, no one to care for them: it is a long, long time since the 
						Ents walked away from the banks of the Baranduin.'

						'What about Tom Bombadil, though?' asked Pippin. 'He lives on the Downs close 
						by. He seems to understand trees.'
						<BR>
					'What about whom?' said Treebeard. 'Tombombadil? Tom- bombadil? So that is what 
					you call him. Oh, he has got a very long name. He understands trees, right 
					enough; but he is not an Ent. He is no herdsman. He laughs and does not 
					interfere. He never made anything go wrong, but he never cured anything, 
					either. Why, why, it is all the difference between walking in the fields and 
					trying to keep a garden; between, between passing the time of a day to a sheep 
					on the hillside, or even maybe sitting down and studying sheep till you know 
					what they feel about grass, and being a shepherd. Sheep get like shepherd, and 
					shepherd like sheep, it is said, very slowly. But it is quicker and closer with 
					Ents and trees. Like some Men and their horses and dogs, only quicker and 
					closer even than that. For Ents are more like Elves: less interested in 
					themselves than Men are, better at getting inside; and Ents are more like Men, 
					more changeable than Elves are, quicker at catching the outside; only they do

					(10) Something must be said here of 'Giant Treebeard', for he emerged into a 
					scrap of actual narrative at this time (and had been mentioned by Gandalf to 
					Frodo in Rivendell. p. 363: I was caught in Fangorn and spent many weary days 
					as a prisoner of the Giant Treebeard'). There exists a single sheet of 
					manuscript, which began as a letter dated 'July 27 - 29th 1939, but which my 
					father covered on both sides with fine ornamental script (one side of the sheet 
					is reproduced opposite). Among the writings on the page are the words 'July 
					Summer Diversions' and lines from Chaucer's Reeve 's Tale - for these 
					'Diversions' were a series of public entertainments held at Oxford in the 
					course of which my father, attired as Chaucer, recited that Tale. But the page 
					is chiefly taken up with a text on which he afterwards pencilled Tree Beard.
					<P align="justify">When Frodo heard the voice he looked up, but he could see 
						nothing through the thick entangled branches. Suddenly he felt a quiver in the 
						gnarled tree-trunk against which he was leaning, and before he could spring 
						away he was pushed, or kicked, forward onto his knees. Picking himself up he 
						looked at the tree, and even as he looked, it took a stride towards him. He 
						scrambled out of the way, and a deep rumbling chuckle came down out of the 
						tree-top.

					'Where are you, little beetle?' said the voice. 'If you don't let me know where

					<P align="justify">'I can't see any leg,' said Frodo. 'And where are you?''You must

						voice answered. 'If you haven't heard of me before, you ought to have done; and 
						anyway you are in my garden.'
						<BR>
						'I can't see any garden,' said Frodo. 'Do you know what a garden looks like?' 
						'I have one of my own: there are flowers and plants in it, and a fence round 
						it; but there is nothing of the kind here.' 'O yes! there is. Only you have 
						walked through the fence without noticing it; and you can't see the plants, 
						because you are down underneath them by their roots.'
						<BR>
					It was only then when Frodo looked closer that he saw that what he had taken 
					for smooth tree-stems were the stalks of gigantic flowers - and what he had 
					thought was the stem of a monstrous oaktree was really a thick gnarled leg with 
					a rootlike foot and many branching toes.

						'How very sad!' said Pippin. 'How was it that they all died?'

						'They did not die!' said Treebeard. 'I never said died. We lost them, I said. 
						We lost them and we cannot find them.' He sighed. 'I thought most folk knew

						Elves and Men from Mirkwood to Gondor. They cannot be quite forgotten.'

						'Well, I am afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to the

						<BR>
						'Yes, I will indeed,' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. 'But I 
						cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our talk: tomorrow 
						we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey to begin.''It is 
						rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'When the world was 
						young, and the woods were wide and wild, the Ents and the Entwives – and there 
						were Entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness of Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the 
						lightfooted, in the days of our youth! – they walked together and they housed 
						together. But our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the Ents gave 
						their love to things that they met in the world, and the Entwives gave their 
						thought to other things, for the Ents loved the great trees; and the wild 
						woods, and the slopes of the high hills; and they drank of the 
						mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path; 
						and they learned of the Elves and spoke with the Trees. But the Entwives gave 
						their minds to the lesser trees, and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the 
						feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe in the thicket, and the wild apple 
						and the cherry blossoming in spring, and the green herbs in the waterlands in 
						summer, and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields. They did not desire to 
						speak with these things; but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to 
						them. The Entwives ordered them to grow according to their wishes, and bear 
						leaf and fruit to their liking; for the Entwives desired order, and plenty, and 
						peace (by which they meant that things should remain where they had set them). 
						So the Entwives made gardens to live in. But we Ents went on wandering, and we 
						only came to the gardens now and again. Then when the Darkness came in the 
						North, the Entwives crossed the Great River, and made new gardens, and tilled 
						new fields, and we saw them more seldom. After the Darkness was overthrown the 
						land of the Entwives blossomed richly, and their fields were full of corn. Many 
						men learned the crafts of the Entwives and honoured them greatly; but we were 
						only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here we still 
						are, while all the gardens of the Entwives are wasted: Men call them the Brown 
						Lands now.
						<BR>
						'I remember it was long ago – in the time of the war between Sauron and the Men 
						of the Sea – desire came over me to see Fimbrethil again. Very fair she was 
						still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though little like the Entmaiden of 
						old. For the Entwives were bent and browned by their labour; their hair parched 
						by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their 
						eyes were still the eyes of our own people. We crossed over Anduin and came to 
						their land: but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had 
						passed over it. But the Entwives were not there. Long we called, and long we 
						searched; and we asked all folk that we met which way the Entwives had gone. 
						Some said they had never seen them; and some said that they had seen them 
						walking away west, and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we 
						went could we find them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild wood called, 
						and we returned to it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and 
						look for the Entwives, walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful 
						names. But as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far. And now 
						the Entwives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and grey. The 
						Elves made many songs concerning the Search of the Ents, and some of the songs 
						passed into the tongues of Men. But we made no songs about it, being content to 
						chant their beautiful names when we thought of the Entwives. We believe that we 
						may meet again in a time to come, and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land 
						where we can live together and both be content. But it is foreboded that that 
						will only be when we have both lost all that we now have. And it may well be 
						that that time is drawing near at last. For if Sauron of old destroyed the 
						gardens, the Enemy today seems likely to wither all the woods.

						'There was an Elvish song that spoke of this, or at least so I understand it. 
						It used to be sung up and down the Great River. It was never an Entish song,
