<BR><B>a.</B> LsR (HME5)/2:5. The Lhammas. Lhammas B. Of the Valian 
          Tongue and its Descendants. <BR>[§9]<BR>Of the language of the Dwarves little is known 
to us, save that its origin is as dark as is the origin of the Dwarvish race 
itself; and their tongues are not akin to other tongues, but wholly alien, and 
they are harsh and intricate, and few have essayed to learn them. (Thus saith 
Rumil in his writings concerning the speeches of the earth of old, but I, 
Pengolod, have heard it said by some that Aule first made the Dwarves, longing 
for the coming of Elves and Men, and desiring those to whom he could teach his 
crafts and wisdom. And he thought in his heart that he could forestall Iluvatar. 
But the Dwarves have no spirit indwelling, as have Elves and Men, the Children 
of Iluvatar, and this the Valar cannot give. Therefore the Dwarves have skill 
and craft, but no art, and they make no poetry. Aule devised a speech for them 
afresh, for his delight [is] in invention, and it has therefore no kinship with 
others; and they have made this harsh in use. Their tongues are, therefore, 
Aulian; and survive yet in a few places with the Dwarves in Middle-earth, and 
besides that the languages of Men are derived in part from them.)<BR>/Comm. on 
Lhammas B, §9/. The legend of Aule's making of the Dwarves has appeared in AB 2 
(annal 104), in a passage strikingly similar to the present, and containing the 
same phrase 'the Dwarves have no spirit indwelling'.
<P align=justify><B>b.</B> LsR (HME5)/2:3. The Later Annals of Beleriand /AB 2/. 
<BR>Year 104 [154].<BR>About this time the 
Gnomes climbed Eredlindon and gazed eastward, but they did not pass into the 
lands beyond. In those mountains the folk of Cranthir came first upon the 
Dwarves, and there was yet no enmity between them, and nonetheless little love. 
It was not known in those days whence the Dwarves had origin, save that they 
were not of Elf-kin or of mortal kind, nor yet of Morgoth's breeding. But it is 
said by some of the wise in Valinor, as I have since learned," that Aule made 
the Dwarves long ago, desiring the coming of the Elves and of Men, for he wished 
to have learners to whom he could teach his crafts of hand, and he could not 
wait upon the designs of Iluvatar. But the Dwarves have no spirit indwelling, as 
have the Children of the Creator, and they have skill but not art; and they go 
back into the stone of the mountains of which they were made.<BR><P align=justify><B>c.</B> WJ (HME11)/2:13. The Later Quenta Silmarillion /LQ 1 + LQ 2/. Concerning the Dwarves.
<BR>[§2]. The Naugrim are not of Elf-kind, nor of Man-kind, nor yet of 
Melkor's breeding; and the Noldor in Middle-earth knew not whence they came, 
holding that they were alien to the Children, albeit in many ways like unto 
them. But in Valinor the wise have learned that the Dwarves were made in secret 
by Aule, while Earth was yet dark; for he desired the coming of the Children of 
Iluvatar, that he might have learners to whom he could teach his crafts and 
lore, and he was unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of Iluvatar. 
Wherefore, though the Dwarves are like the Orcs in this: that they came of the 
wilfulness of one of the Valar, they are not evil; for they were not made out of 
malice in mockery of the Children, but came of the desire of Aule's heart to 
make things of his own after the pattern of the designs of Iluvatar. And since 
they came in the days of the power of Melkor, Aule made them strong to endure. 
Therefore they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship and in enmity, and 
they suffer toil and hunger and hurt of body more hardily than all other 
speaking-folk. And they live long, far beyond the span of Men, and yet not for 
ever. Aforetime the Noldor held that dying they returned unto the earth and the 
stone of which they were made; yet that is not their own belief. For they say 
that Aule cares for them and gathers them in Mandos in halls set apart for them, 
and there they wait, not in idleness but in the practice of crafts and the 
learning of yet deeper lore. And Aule, they say, declared to their Fathers of 
old that Iluvatar had accepted from him the work of his desire, and that 
Iluvatar will hallow them and give them a place among the Children in the End. 
Then their part shall be to serve Aule and to aid him in the remaking of Arda 
after the Last Battle.

<BR>LsR (HME5)/2:6. Quenta Silmarillion /QS/. Chapter 3 (a).<BR>/After 
the Lamps' destruction/ in the North Morgoth built his strength, and gathered 
his demons about him. These were the first made of his creatures: their 
hearts were of fire, and they had whips of flame. The Gnomes in later days 
named them Balrogs. But in that time Morgoth made many monsters of divers 
kinds and shapes that long troubled the world; yet the Orcs were not made 
until he had looked upon the Elves, and he made them in mockery of the 
Children of Iluvatar.<BR>/Draft of this passage, quoted and commented in Comm. 
on Chapter 3(a), §18/ The original text of the passage concerning the demons 
of Morgoth ran as follows: '... in the North Morgoth built his strength, and 
gathered his demon-broods about him, whom the Gnomes after knew as Balrogs: they 
had whips of flame. The Uvanimor he made, monsters of divers kinds and 
shapes; but the Orcs were not made until he had looked upon the Elves'. The 
term Uvanimor occurs in the Lost Tales, /HME/ 1. 75 ('monsters, giants, and 
ogres') / Fr.1/, etc.; cf. Vanimor' the Beautiful'. /.../ On the question of 
when the Orcs first came into being see /HME 5/ p. 148 / Fr.96:Comm./ and 
commentary on QS §62 / Fr.103a/. It is said in The Fall of.Numenor II (§1) / 
Fr.93/ that the Orcs are 'mockeries of the creatures of Iluvatar' (cf. also 
The Lost Road, /HME 5/ p. 65 / Fr.94/). In QS §62 / Fr.103a/ the idea that 
the Orcs were mockeries of the Elves is found in the text as originally 
written.
<P align=justify> <B>Fr.103a-b</B>
<BR><B>a.</B> LsR (HME5)/2:6. Quenta Silmarillion /QS/. Chapter 5. 
<BR>/Aftermath of the Trees' destruction and the fight with 
Ungoliant/. Thus Morgoth came back to his ancient habitation, and he built 
anew his vaults and dungeons and great towers, in that place which the Gnomes 
after knew as Angband. There countless became the hosts of his beasts and 
demons; and he brought into being the race of the Orcs, and they grew and 
multiplied in the bowels of the earth. These Orcs Morgoth made in envy and 
mockery of the Elves, and they were made of stone, but their hearts of 
hatred. Glamhoth, the hosts of hate, the Gnomes have called them. Goblins they 
may be called, but in ancient days they were strong and fell. <BR>Comm. on 
Chapter 5, §62. Q has 'To his aid came the Orcs and Balrogs that lived yet in 
the lowest places of Angband', but Orcs are absent here in QS. /.../ In Q the 
passage about Morgoth's making of the Orcs, precursor of this in QS, is 
placed earlier (/HME/ IV.82 / Fr.76), before the making of the stars and 
the awakening of the Elves; at the corresponding place in QS (§ 18) / Fr.102/ 
it is said that 'the Orcs were not made until he had looked upon the Elves.' 
In Q, at the place (/HME/ IV. 93 / Fr.77/) corresponding to the present 
passage in QS, it is said that 'countless became the number of the hosts of 
his Orcs and demons' - i.e. the Orcs were already in existence before Morgoth's 
return (and so could come to his aid when they heard his cry); but there is a 
direction in Q at this point (/HME/ IV. 93 note 8 / Fr.77, note 8/) to bring 
in the making of the Orcs here rather than earlier (the reason for this being 
the idea that the Orcs were made 'in mockery of the Children 
of Iluvatar').
        <P align=justify> <B>b.</B> RSh (HME6)/10. The Attack on Weathertop.<BR>Note 9 to 
The Attack on Weathertop. /.../ There are other very roughly written texts 
giving a resume of a part of 'The Silmarillion' 
<BR>But Morgoth, the greatest 
of the Powers, made war upon the Gods, and he destroyed the Trees, and fled. 
And he took with him the immortal gems, the Silmarils, that were made by the 
Elves of the light of the Trees, and in which alone now the ancient radiance 
of the days of bliss remained. In the north of the Middle-earth he set up his 
throne Angband, the Halls of Iron under Thangorodrim the Mountain of Thunder; 
and he grew in strength and darkness; and he brought forth the Orcs 
and goblins, and the Balrogs, demons of fire. But the High Elves of the West 
forsook the land of the Gods and returned to the earth, and made war upon him 
to regain the jewels.<BR>/Comm./ Very curious is the statement here that when 
Morgoth returned to Middle-earth after the destruction of the Trees 'he 
brought forth the Orcs and goblins, and the Balrogs, demons of fire.' It was 
certainly my father's view at this period that the Orcs were then first 
engendered (see V. 233, §62 and commentary / Fr.103a/), but the Balrogs were 
far older in their beginning (V. 212, §18 / Fr.102/), and indeed came to 
rescue Morgoth from Ungoliante at the time of his return: 'to his aid there 
came the Balrogs that lived yet in the deepest places of his ancient 
fortress.'

<BR>Of old the lord of Ossiriand was Denethor, friend of Thingol; but he 
was slain in battle when he marched to the aid of Thingol against Melko, in 
the days when the Orcs were first made and broke the starlit peace of 
Beleriand.
<BR>Comm. on Chapter 9, §115. With 'when the Orcs were first made' 
cf. QS §62 / Fr.103/: 'he brought into being the race of the Orcs' (i.e. when 
Morgoth came back to Middle-earth).

<BR>For though the Dwarfs did not serve 
Morgoth, yet they were in some things more like to his people than to the 
Elves. /.../ The Naugrim were not of the Elf-race nor of mortal kind, nor yet 
of Morgoth's breeding; and in those days the Gnomes knew not whence they 
came. [But it is said by the wise in Valinor, as we have learned since, that 
Aule made the Dwarfs while the world was yet dark, desiring the coming of the 
Children of Iluvatar, that he might have learners to whom he could teach his 
lore and craft, and being unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of 
Iluvatar. Wherefore the Dwarfs are like the Orcs in this, that they come of 
the wilfulness of one of the Valar; but they were not made out of malice and 
mockery, and were not begotten of evil purpose. Yet they derive their thought 
and being after their measure from only one of the Powers, whereas Elves and 
Men, to whomsoever among the Valar they chiefly turn, have kinship with all in 
some degree. Therefore the works of the Dwarfs have great skill, but small 
beauty, save where they imitate the arts of the Eldar; and the Dwarfs return 
unto the earth and the stone of the hills of which they were fashioned]. /../ 
They /the Dwarfs/ aided the Gnomes greatly in their war with the Orcs 
of Morgoth ; but it is not thought that they would have refused to smithy 
also for Morgoth, if he had had need of their work, or had been open to their 
trade.
<BR>Comm. on Chapter 10, §122. It is remarkable that at this time the 
statement that the Dwarves were 'in some things more like to Morgoth's people 
than to the Elves' still survived from Q (IV. 104); but this is now palliated 
by what is said in §123, where the likeness of the Dwarves to the Orcs 
is represented only as an analogous limitation of natural powers consequent 
on their origins.

<BR>GLAM- Noldorin form of LAM, also influenced by NGAL(AM). 
Noldorin glamb, glamm shouting, confused noise; Glamhoth = 'the barbaric 
host', Orcs . glambr, glamor echo; glamren echoing; cf. Eredlemrin = Dor. 
Lominorthin. glavro to babble, glavrol babbling.
<BR>NDAK- slay. Old Noldorin ndakie to slay /.../ *ndako warrior, soldier: Old Noldorin ndoko, Noldorin 
daug chiefly used of Orcs, also called Boldog. [Boldog is an Orc-captain in the 
Lay of Leithian and in Q §10. The meaning here is that Boldog was used beside 
daug ; see NGWAL]. 
<BR>NGAL- / NGALAM- talk loud or incoherently. Quenya nalme 
clamour; Noldorin glamb, glamm (*ngalambe, influenced by lambe ) barbarous 
speech; Glamhoth = Orcs. See LAM, GLAM. [The stem was changed subsequently to 
NGYAL- and Quenya nalme to yalme.] 
<BR>NGWAL- torment. Quenya ungwale torture; 
nwalya- to pain, torment; nwalka cruel. Noldorin balch cruel; baul torment, 
cf. Bal- in Balrog or Bolrog , and Orc-name Boldog = 
Orc-warrior 'Torment-slayer' (cf. NDAK). 
<BR>OROK- *orku goblin: Quenya orko, 
pl. orqi. Old Noldorin orko, pl. orkui; Noldorin orch, pl. yrch. Doriathrin 
urch, pl. urchin. Danian Elvish urc, pl. yrc. 
<BR>RUK- demon. Quenya rauko 
demon, malarauko (*ngwalarauko, cf. NGWAL); Noldorin rhaug, 
Balrog.

/Rend./
<BR>Balrog is said to be an Orc-word with no pure Qenya equivalent: 
'borrowed Malaroko-'; contrast the Etymologies, stems NCWAL, RUK. 
Gothmog '= Voice of Goth (Morgoth), an Orc-name.' Morgoth is explained at its place in 
the list as 'formed from his Orc-name Goth "Lord or Master", with mor "dark 
or black" prefixed.' These entries in the List of Names have been discussed 
in /HME/ II. P.67. In the Etymologies the element goth is differently 
explained in Gothmog (GOS, GOTH) and in Morgoth (KOT, but with a suggestion that 
the name 'may also contain GOTH ). 
<BR>Orcs 'Gnomish orch, pl. eirch, erch; 
Qenya ork, orqui borrowed from Gnomish. A folk devised and brought into being 
by Morgoth to war on Elves and Men; sometimes translated "Goblins", but 
they were of nearly human stature.' See the entry OROK in the 
Etymologies.

        <BR>/Version I. Speech of unnamed person, obviously Gandalf/ 
<BR>In the very 
ancient days the Ring-lord made many of these Rings: and sent them out through 
the world to snare people. He sent them to all sorts of folk - the Elves had 
many, and there are now many elfwraiths in the world, but the Ring-lord 
cannot rule them; the goblins got many, and the invisible goblins are very 
evil and wholly under the Lord; dwarves I don't believe had any; some say the 
rings don't work on them: they are too solid. Men had few, but they were most 
quickly overcome and. /.../ Other creatures got them. Do you remember Bilbo's 
story of Gollum? (7) We don't know where Gollum comes in - certainly not elf, 
nor goblin; he is probably not dwarf; we rather believe he really belongs to 
an ancient sort of hobbit.
<BR>Note 7. After this sentence my father wrote: 
'Gollum I think some sort of distant kinsman of the goblin sort.' Since this 
is contradicted in the next sentence it was obviously rejected in the act of 
writing; he crossed it out later.
<BR>/Version II. Gandalf's speech/ 'The elves 
had many, and there are now many elf-wraiths in the world; the goblins had 
some and their wraiths are very evil and wholly under the command of

much burning and ruin. The dwarves were growing afraid. Goblins 
were multiplying again and reappearing. Trolls of a new and most malevolent 
kind were abroad; giants were spoken of, a Big Folk only far bigger and 
stronger than Men the Big Folk, and no stupider, indeed often full of cunning 
and wizardry. And there were vague hints of things or creatures more terrible

Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power 
was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and 
growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were 
abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons.

        <BR>He /Bilbo/ told me /Frodo/ tales of the dwarves and 
goblins. But I have no idea where they /Moria's dwellings/ are.' 'They are 
not far away,' said the wizard /Gandalf/. 'They are in these mountains. They 
were made by the Dwarves of Durin's clan many hundreds of years ago, when 
elves dwelt in Hollin, and there was peace between the two races. In those 
ancient days Durin dwelt in Caron-dun, and there was traffic on the Great 
River. But the Goblins - fierce orcs (35) in great number - drove them out 
after many wars, and most of the dwarves that escaped removed far into 
the North. /.../ If there are orcs in the mines, it will prove ill for us. 
But most of the goblins of the Misty Mountains were destroyed in the Battle 
of Five Armies at the Lonely Mountain. There is a chance that the mines are 
still deserted.
<BR>Note 35. This is not the first use of the word Orcs in the LR 
papers: Gandalf refers to 'orcs and goblins' among the servants of the Dark 
Lord, pp. 211 / Fr.114a/, 364 / Fr.114b/. /.../ But the rarity of the usage 
at this stage is remarkable. The word Orc goes back to the Lost Tales, and 
had been pervasive in all my father's subsequent writings. In the Lost Tales 
the two terms were used as equivalents, though some times apparently 
distinguished (see II. 364 /=Index/, entry Goblins). A clue may be found in a 
passage that occurs in both the earlier and the later Quenta (IV.82, 
V.233): 'Goblins they may be called, but in ancient days they mere strong and 
fell.' At this stage it seems that 'Orcs' are to be regarded as a more 
formidable kind of 'Goblin', so in the preliminary sketch for 'The Mines of 
Moria' (p. 443) Gandalf says 'there are goblins - of very evil kind, larger 
than usual, real orcs.' - It is incidentally notable that in the first 
edition of The Hobbit the word Orcs is used only once (at the end of Chapter 
VII 'Queer Lodgings'), while in the published LR goblins is hardly ever used.

<BR>In the days of the Dragon, Thror 
returned thither. But he was slain by an Orc, and though that was revenged by 
Thorin and Dain, and many goblins were slain in war. /.../ /Comm./ This passage, 
of which only a trace remains in FR (pp. 253 - 4), reveals the development of 
new conceptions in the history of the Dwarves. In the original text of 'The 
Ring Goes South' (VI.429) Gandalf said that the Goblins drove the Dwarves 
from Moria, and most of those that escaped removed into the North. This must 
have been based on what was told in The Hobbit: in Chapter III Elrond had said 
that 'there are still forgotten treasures to be found in the deserted caverns 
of the mines of Moria, since the dwarf and goblin war', and in Chapter IV 
there was a reference to the goblins having 'spread in secret after the sack 
of the mines of Moria'. Presumably therefore what my father said in the first 
version of 'The Ring Goes South' was what he actually had in mind when he wrote 
those passages in The Hobbit: the Goblins drove the Dwarves out of Moria. 
<BR>Note 3. In the original edition of The Hobbit the goblin who slew Thror in 
Moria was not named, as he is not in the present passage ('he was slain by an 
Orc'). In the third edition of 1966 the name Azog was introduced (from LR) in 
Chapter I as that of the slayer of Thror, and a footnote was added in Chapter 
XVII stating that Bolg, leader of the Goblins in the Battle of Five Armies, was 
the son of Azog.

<BR>When Gandalf was striving to find the spell that would open the

Dwarf, or Goblin' (FR 'of Elves or Men or Orcs') that was ever so used /.../ 
'Goblins' appear again, as in the old version, where FR has 'Orcs', in 
Gandalf's 'There are older and fouler things than goblins in the deep places 
of the world.' /.../ The dwarves carried much away; and though the dread of 
its dark mazes has protected Moria from Men and Elves it has not defended it 
from the goblins, who have often invaded it and plundered it.' Against these 
my father wrote: 'Mithril is now nearly all lost. Orcs plunder it and pay 
tribute to Sauron who is collecting it /.../ 'No one knows,' said Gandalf. 
'None have dared to seek for the armouries and treasure chambers down in the 
deep places since the dwarves fled. Unless it be plundering orcs. /.../ 'They 
were,' said Gimli, 'but orcs have plundered often inside Moria nonetheless.

        <BR>But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry 
          had reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, 
          clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind 
          him his followers clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was 
          swart, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded 
          a great spear. With a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's 
          sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under 
          Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged into the 
          Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught 
          him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned. 
          Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it broke. But even as 
          the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar, Anduril 
          came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst 
          asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, 
          as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them. `As I stood there I could hear 
          orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought they would burst 
          it open. I could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in 
          their own hideous language. All I caught was ghвsh; that is "fire". 
          Then something came into the chamber - I felt it through the door, and 
          the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the 
          iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. Arrows fell among 
          them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf's hat 
          and stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond the 
          fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be hundreds of orcs.

Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one 
final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless lines of 
marching Orcs; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And there were 
battalions of Men, too. Many of them carried torches, and in the flare I 
could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and 
dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil-looking. But there were some 
others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, 
squint-eyed. Do you know, they reminded me at once of that Southerner at 
Bree: only he was not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.' 'I 
thought of him too,' said Aragorn. 'We had many of these half-orcs to deal with

is a mark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot 
abide the Sun; but Saruman's Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I 
wonder what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the 
races of Orcs and Men? That would be a black evil!' Treebeard rumbled for 
a moment, as if he were pronouncing some deep, subterranean 
Entish malediction. 'Some time ago I began to wonder how Orcs dared to pass 
through my woods so freely,' he went on. 'Only lately did I guess that

Uftak, but on the other hand the double-barrelled Orc-name Naglur-Danlo is

left where he was) by Shagrat and his friends in Shelob's larder, 'wide awake

writing (and in a following draft the names became reversed again at one

came, save only Yavanna and Orome; and Yavanna often would walk there in the 
shadows, grieving because all the growth and promise of the Spring of Arda 
was checked. And she set a sleep upon many fair things that had arisen in the 
Spring, both tree and herb and beast and bird, so that they should not 
age but should wait for a time of awakening that yet should he. But Melkor 
dwelt in Utumno, and he slept not, but watched, and laboured; and the evil 
things that he had perverted walked abroad, and the dark and slumbering woods 
were haunted by monsters and shapes of dread. And in Utumno he wrought the 
race of demons whom the Elves after named the Balrogs. But these came not yet 
from the gates of Utumno, because of the watchfulness of Orome. <BR>/Comm. to 
§30/. In AAm there is now recounted the laying by Yavanna of a sleep on living 
things that had awoken in the Spring of Arda, of which there is no trace in 
QS (or in the later rewritings). The making of the Balrogs is then mentioned; 
and while in AAm (§17) the account of Melkor's 'host', spirits 'out of the 
voids of Ea' and 'secret friends and spies among the Maiar', is fuller than 
in the other tradition at any stage, the Balrogs are still firmly stated to 
be demons of his own making, and moreover to have been made in Utumno at this 
time. On the conception of Balrogs in AAm see further under §§42-5 / Fr.161/,

that he had perverted walked far abroad, and the dark and slumbering woods 
were haunted by monsters and shapes of dread. And in Utumno he multiplied the 
race of the evil spirits that followed him, the Umaiar, of whom the 
chief were those demons whom the Elves afterwards named the Balrogath. But 
they did not yet come forth from the gates of Utumno because of their fear of 
Orome. <BR>The latter part of this passage is of much interest as showing a 
marked development from the idea that Melkor 'made' the Balrogs at this time 
(see p. 78 / Fr.160 suppl.c, Comm./). They now become 'evil spirits (Umaiar) 
that followed him' - but he could 'multiply' them. The term Umaiar, not 
met before, stands to Maiar as Uvanimor to Vanimor (see /HME/ IV.293,

love of horses and of hounds, but all beasts were in his thought, and he 
hunted only the monsters and fell creatures of Melkor. If he descried them 
afar or his great hounds got wind of them, then his white horse, Nahar, shone 
like silver as it ran through the shadows, and the sleeping earth trembled at

<BR>MR (HME 10)/2. The Annals of Aman /AAm /
<BR>Year 1085 And when the Elves had dwelt in the world five and thirty 
          Years of the Valar (which is like unto three hundred and thirty-five 
          of our years) it chanced that Orome rode to Endon in his hunting, and 
          he turned north by the shores of Helkar and passed under the shadows 
          of the Orokarni, the Mountains of the East. And on a sudden Nahar set 
          up a great neighing and then stood still. And Orome wondered and sat 
          silent, and it seemed to him that in the quiet of the land under the 
          stars he heard afar off many voices singing.
<BR>Thus it was that the Valar found at last, as it were by chance, 
those whom they had so long awaited /i.e., the Elves/. And when Orome looked 
upon them he was filled with wonder, as though they were things unforeseen 
and unimagined; and he loved the Quendi, and named them Eldar, the people of 
the stars.  The original manuscript page was interpolated at this point, a 
passage being written in the-margin as follows: <BR>Yet by after-knowledge 
the masters of lore say sadly that Orome was not, mayhap, the first of 
the Great Ones to look upon the Elves. for Melkor was on the watch, and his 
spies were many. And it is thought that lurking near his servants had led 
astray some of the Quendi that ventured afield, and they took them as 
captives to Utumno, and there enslaved them. Of these slaves it is held came 
the Orkor that were afterward chief foes of the Eldar. And Melkor's lies were 
soon abroad, so that whispers were heard among the Quendi, warning them that 
if any of their kindred passed away into the shadows and were seen no more, 
they must beware of a fell huntsman on a great horse, for he it was that 
carried them off to devour them. Hence it was that at the approach of Orome many 
of the Quendi fled and hid themselves. <BR>The original text then continues, 
with a new date 1086, 'Swiftly Orome rode back to Valinor and brought tidings 
to the Valar' (see §46 below). But the interpolated passage just given 
was subsequently replaced on a new page by the following long and important 
passage §§43 - 5 (found in the typescript as typed): <BR>Yet many of the 
Quendi were adread at his coming. This was the doing of Melkor. For 
by after-knowledge the masters of lore say that Melkor, ever watchful, was 
first aware of the awakening of the Quendi, and sent shadows and evil spirits 
to watch and waylay them. So it came to pass, some years ere the coming of 
Orome, that if any of the Elves strayed far abroad, alone or few together, 
they would often vanish and never return; and the Quendi said that the Hunter 
had caught them, and they were afraid. Even so, in the most ancient songs of 
our people, of which some echoes are remembered still in the West, we hear of 
the shadow-shapes that walked in the hills about Kuivienen, or would pass 
suddenly over the stars; and of the dark Rider upon his wild horse 
that pursued those that wandered to take them and devour them. Now Melkor 
greatly hated and feared the riding of Orome, and either verily he sent his 
dark servants as riders, or he set lying whispers abroad, for the purpose 
that the Quendi should shun Orome, if ever haply they met. <BR>Thus it was that 
when Nahar neighed and Orome indeed came among them, some of the Quendi 
hid themselves, and some fled and were lost. But those that had the courage 
to stay perceived swiftly that the Great Rider was noble and fair and no 
shape out of Darkness; for the Light of Aman was in his face, and all the 
noblest of the Quendi were drawn towards it.  But of those hapless who were 
ensnared by Melkor little is known of a certainty. For who of the living hath 
descended into the pits of Utumno, or hath explored the darkness of the counsels 
of Melkor? Yet this is held true by the wise of Eressea: that all those of 
the Quendi that came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were 
put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty and wickedness were 
corrupted and enslaved. Thus did Melkor breed the hideous race of the Orkor 
in envy and mockery of the Eldar, of whom they were afterwards the bitterest 
foes. For the Orkor had life and multiplied after the manner of the Children 
of Iluvatar; and naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance thereof, 
could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the Ainulindale before the 
Beginning: so say the wise. And deep in their dark hearts the Orkor loathed the 
Master whom they served in fear, the maker only of their misery. This maybe 
was the vilest deed of Melkor and the most hateful to Eru.<BR>/Comm./ (§42 - 
5 The origin of the Orcs. The first appearance of the idea that their origin 
was connected with the Elves is in QS §18 / Fr.102/, and later in QS (§62) / 
Fr.103a/ it is said that when Morgoth returned to Middle-earth after the 
destruction of the Trees he brought into being the race of the Orcs, and they 
grew and multiplied in the bowels of the earth. These Orcs Morgoth made in 
envy and mockery of the Elves, and they were made of stone, but their hearts of 
hatred. (For my father's changing views concerning the time of the origin of 
the Orcs in the chronology of the Elder Days see /HME/ IV.314, /HME/ V.238. 
/Frr.92, 103a/) In the interpolation into the manuscript of AAm and its 
subsequent rewriting and extension (pp. 72 - 4 /see this Fr., above, §42/) 
there appears, together with the story of the Rider who was rumoured to carry 
off the Quendi if they strayed, the theory that Melkor bred the Orcs (here 
called Orkor) 'in envy and mockery of the Eldar' from Quendi enslaved in the 
east of Middle-earth before ever Orome came upon them. It is explicit (§45) 
that Melkor could make nothing that had life of its own since his rebellion; 
but this is in sharp contradiction to §30 / Fr.160 suppl.c/, where it is said 
that 'in Utumno he wrought the race of demons whom the Elves after named the 
Balrogs'. I do not think that the interpolation in which the former of these 
statements appears was made after any very long interval: my father's views 
on this subject seem to have been changing swiftly, and a different account 
of the origin of the Balrogs is found in the soon abandoned type- script which I 
have called AAm* (see p. 79, §30 / Fr.160 suppl.d/). The retention of the 
statement in §30, despite its contradiction to that in §45, was no doubt due 
to oversight, and both appear in the main typescript of AAm. - See further on 
the question of the origin of the Orcs p. 123, §127 / Fr.162 b/, and pp. 408

Morgoth being freed gathered again all his servants that he could find, and 
he delved anew his vast vaults and his dungeons in that place which the 
Noldor after called Angband, and above them he reared the reeking towers 
of Thangorodrim. There countless became the hosts of his beasts and his 
demons; and thence there now came forth in hosts beyond count the fell race 
of the Orkor, that had grown and multiplied in the bowels of the earth like a 
plague. These creatures Morgoth bred in envy and mockery of the Eldar. In 
form (5) they were like unto the Children of Iluvatar, yet foul to look upon; 
for they were bred (6) in hatred, and with hatred they were filled; and he 
loathed the things that he had wrought, and with loathing they served him. 
Their voices were as the clashing of stones, and they laughed not save only 
at torment and cruel deeds. The Glamhoth, host of tumult, the Noldor called 
them. (Orcs we may name them; for in days of old they were strong and fell as 
demons. Yet they were not of demon kind, but children (7) of earth corrupted 
by Morgoth, and they could be slain or destroyed by the valiant with weapons 
of war. [But indeed a darker tale some yet tell in Eressea, saying that the 
Orcs were verily in their beginning of the Quendi themselves, a kindred of the 
Avari unhappy whom Morgoth cozened, and then made captive, and so enslaved 
them, and so brought them utterly to ruin. *For, saith Pengolod, Melkor could 
never since the Ainulindale' make of his own aught that had life or the 
semblance of life, and still less might he do so after his treachery in Valinor 
and the fullness of his own corruption.](8) Quoth AElfwine.)  *[footnote

<P align=justify><b>b.</b> /Comm./ to 
§127 The origin of the Orcs. In QS (§62 / Fr.103a/) the idea had already arisen 
that the Orcs originated in mockery of the Elves, but not yet that the Orcs 
were in any other way associated with them: they were a 'creation' of 
Morgoth's own, 'made of stone', and he brought them into being when he 
returned to Middle-earth. As AAm was first written (see notes 5 - 7 above 
/ Fr.162a, Notes 5-7/) this view still held; the word 'made' was still used - 
though not the words 'made of stone'. But in AElfwine's note that follows 
(and which was written continuously with what precedes) they are called 'a 
spawn of earth corrupted by Morgoth'; and the 'darker tale' told in Eressea - 
that the Orcs were in their beginning enslaved and corrupted Elves (Avari) - is 
certainly the first appearance of this idea, contradicting what precedes, or 
perhaps rather at this stage presenting an alternative theory. It is ascribed 
to Pengolod; and Pengolod argues to AElfwine that Melkor could actually make 
nothing that had life, but could only corrupt what was already living. The 
implication of this second theory would probably, though not necessarily, be 
that the Orcs came into being much earlier, before the Captivity of Melkor; 
and that this implication is present is suggested by the footnote reference 
to the Annals of Beleriand - meaning the last version of these Annals, the 
Grey Annals, companion to the Annals of Aman: 'it is said that this he did in 
the Dark ere ever the Quendi were found by Orome.'  At this point my 
father went back to an earlier part of AAm (p. 72, §42 / Fr.161/) 
and interpolated the passage 'Yet by after- knowledge ...', where the idea of 
the capture of wandering Quendi in their earliest days is filled out, though 
it remains only a supposition of the 'masters of lore'. Perhaps at the same 
time he emended the present passage, changing 'he brought now into being' to 
'thence there now came forth in hosts beyond count', 'made' to 'bred', and 'a 
spawn of earth' to 'children of earth'. He then (as I conjecture) developed 
the interpolation at the earlier point much more fully (§§43 - 5 / Fr.161/), 
where the idea becomes less a supposition than a certainty of history: the 
powerlessness of Melkor to make living things is a known fact ('so say the 
wise'). Finally, at a later time (see note 8), he cut out the whole passage at 
the end of §127 beginning 'But indeed a darker tale some yet tell in Eressea 
...' - either because he only then observed that it had been superseded by 
§§43 - 5 and was in any case not in the appropriate place, or because he 
rejected this theory of the origin of the Orcs. See further p. 127, §127 / 
Fr.162 c/.
<P align=justify><b>Fr. 162 </b>
<BR>The word for in 'Orcs we may name them; for in 
days of old they were strong and fell as demons. Yet they were not of demon 
kind' (an observation of AElfwine's) suggests that Orcs is Old English (cf. 
orc-neas in Beowulf line 112), conveniently similar to the Elvish word. This 
would explain why AElfwine said, in effect, 'We may call them Orcs, because 
they were strong and fell as demons, even though they were not in fact 
demons.' In a letter of my father's written on 25 April 1954 (Letters no.144) 
he said that the word Orc 'is as far as I am concerned actually derived from Old 
English orc "demon", but only because of its phonetic suitability' (and also: 
'Orcs... are nowhere clearly stated to be of any particular origin. But since 
they are servants of the Dark Power, and later of Sauron, neither of whom 
could, or would, produce living things, they must be "corruptions"').
<BR><b>c.</b> /Later Comm./ Among the notes and corrections written by my father on the 
typescript in this section of AAm, not all of which need be recorded, there 
are several indicating proposed extensions of the narrative. <BR>/.../ §127 
Against the opening of this paragraph my father wrote: 'The making of this 
fortress as a guard against a landing from the West should come earlier. See 
p. 156, §12. In the typescript the passage concerning the Orcs ran as it 
stands in the text printed from the manuscript on p. 109 only as far as 'they 
could be slain or destroyed by the valiant with weapons of war'; the remainder 
of the paragraph had been struck out in the manuscript (note 8, p. 121 / 
Fr.162a. Note 8/), apart from the words 'Quoth AElfwine' at the end (which 
the typist did not notice and omitted, ending the paragraph at 'weapons of 
war' without closing the brackets). Against the first part of the passage my 
father wrote an X on the typescript and a brief illegible direction of which the 
first word might be 'cut', with a reference to the passage on the subject in 
§45. It is not clear what precisely was to be cut (if I read the word 
correctly), but seeing that he noted on the typescript against the earlier 
passage (p. 80, §43 / Fr.161/): 'Alter this. Orcs are not Elvish', it 
seems likely that the same objection applied here (see further pp. 408 ff. / 
Fr.168/). - He rectified the typist's error in omitting the words 'Quoth 
AElfwine' by cutting out the words '(Orcs we may name them; for', so that the 
text reads: 'The Glamhoth, host of tumult, the Noldor called them. In days of 
old they were strong and fell as demons ...' This was perhaps done without 
consulting the manuscript.

1+ LQ 2 /. The First Phase. Of the Coming of  the Elves.
<BR>In all this time, since Melkor overthrew the Lamps, the Middle-earth east of the 
Mountains was   without light. While the Lamps had shone, growth began there 
which now was checked, because all was   again dark. But already the oldest 
living things had arisen: in the sea the great weeds, and on the   earth the 
shadow of great trees; and in the valleys of the night-clad hills there were 
dark   creatures old and strong. In those lands and forests Orome would often 
hunt; and there too at times   Yavanna came, singing sorrowfully; for she was 
grieved at the darkness of Middle-earth and ill content that it was 
forsaken. But the other Valar came seldom thither; and in the North Melkor 
 built his strength, and gathered his demons about him. These were the first 
made of his creatures: their hearts were of fire, but they were cloaked in 
darkness, and terror went before them; they had whips of flame. Balrogs 
they were named by the Noldor in later days. And in that dark time Melkor 
 made many other monsters of divers shapes and kinds that long troubled the 
world; yet the Orcs were   not made until he had looked upon the Elves, and 
he made them in mockery of the Children of   Iluvatar. His realm spread now 
ever southward over the Middle-earth.   
<BR>/Comm./ § 18 In AAm § 30 (p. 70 / 
Fr.160 suppl.c/) it is said that Melkor 'wrought' the Balrogs in   Utumno 
during the long darkness after the fall of the Lamps; but in an interpolation to 
AAm there   enters the view that Melkor, after his rebellion, could make 
nothing that had life of its own (§45,   see pp. 74, 78 / Fr.161/), and in 
AAm*, the second version of the opening of AAm (p. 79, §30 /   Fr.160 
suppl.d/), the Balrogs become the chief of 'the evil spirits that followed him, 
the Umaiar',   whom at that time he multiplied. The statement in QS §18 / 
Fr.102/ that the Balrogs were 'the first   made of his creatures' survived 
through all the texts of the later revision of the Quenta, but in   the 
margin of one of the copies of LQ 2 my father wrote: 'See Valaquenta for true 
account.' This is   a reference to the passage which appears in the published 
Silmarillion on p. 31:   For of the Maiar many were drawn to his splendour in 
the days of his greatness, and remained in   that allegiance down into his 
darkness; and others he corrupted afterwards to his service with lies   and 
treacherous gifts. Dreadful among these spirits were the Valaraukar, the 
scourges of fire that   in Middle-earth were called the Balrogs, demons of 
terror. The actual text of LQ 2 my father   emended at this time very hastily 
to read: These were the (ealar) spirits who first adhered to him   in the 
days of his splendour, and became most like him in his corruption: their hearts 
were of   fire, but they were cloaked in darkness, and terror went before 
them; they had whips of flame.   Balrogs they were named by the Noldor in 
later days. And in that dark time Melkor bred many other   monsters of divers 
shapes and kinds that long troubled the world; and his realm spread now ever 
  southward over the Middle-earth. But the Orks, mockeries and perversions of 
the Children of Eru,   did not appear until after the Awakening of the Elves. 
  There is a footnote to the word ealar in this passage: 'spirit' (not 
incarnate, which was fea, S   fae). eala 'being'. On the origin of the Orcs 
in AAm (and especially with respect to the word   'perversions' in the 
passage just given) see pp. 78 / Fr.161/, 123 - 4 / Fr.162b/. Orks was my father's late spelling.

<BR> The textual history of this chapter is relatively 
simple (for the late rewriting just referred to,   which extends some little 
way into it, see pp. 292 ff.). The original chapter in QS (V.232 - 8 /see 
Fr.103a/, where it is numbered 5) was corrected, not very extensively, at 
the time of the 1951 revision, and as corrected was typed in the amanuensis 
text LQ 1. This received no corrections at   all, but on the later amanuensis 
typescript LQ 2 my father made a few changes, mostly the regular   alteration 
of names. In this case I do not give the revised text, but record individually 
the significant changes made to QS. /.../
<BR> §62 /see Fr.103a/. The 
passage concerning the Orcs, from 'he brought into being the race of the 
Orcs' to the end of the paragraph, was rewritten as follows:   he 
brought into being the race of the Orkor,* and they grew and multiplied in the 
bowels of the   earth. These creatures Morgoth made in envy and mockery of 
the Elves. Therefore in form they were   like unto the Children of Iluvatar, 
yet foul to look upon; for they were made in hatred, and with   hatred they 
were filled. Their voices were as the clashing of stones, and they laughed not, 
save   only at torment and cruel deeds. Clamhoth, the hosts of tumult, the 
Noldor called them. <BR> *[footnote to the text) In Gnomish speech this name is 
orch of one, yrch of many. Orcs we may name   them, for in the ancient days 
they were strong and fell as demons; yet they were of other kind, a   spawn 
of earth corrupted by the power of Morgoth, and they could be slain or destroyed 
by the   valiant: quoth AElfwine. <BR> This is closely related to AAm §127, 
as that was first written (see pp.120-1, notes 5-7 / Fr.162a,   Notes 5-7/, 
and commentary p. 123 / Fr.162b/), and contains the same conjunction of two 
apparently   different theories, that the Orcs were 'made' by Morgoth and 
that they were 'a spawn of earth'   corrupted by him. My father then altered 
the passage by cutting out AElfwine's footnote to the word   Orkor but adding 
a closely similar passage in the body of the text, thus:   Glamhoth, the 
hosts of tumult, the Noldor called them. Orcs we may name them,* for in ancient 
days   they were strong and fell as demons. Yet they were not of demon-kind, 
but a spawn of earth   corrupted by Morgoth, and they could be slain or 
destroyed by the valiant with weapons of war.   <BR> *[footnote to the text] 
Quoth AElfwine.   This rearrangement is puzzling, for AElfwine's contribution 
can hardly be limited to the words   'Orcs we may name them' (see p. 124 / 
Fr.162b/); but perhaps by placing the asterisk at this point   my father 
meant to indicate that all that follows it was added by AElfwine. On the LQ 
typescript he   changed it again, putting the whole passage from 'Orcs we may 
name them' into a footnote.   On the QS manuscript he scribbled later, 
against the first part of the passage, concerning the   making of the Orcs: 
'Alter this. See Annals.' This refers to the change introduced into AAm whereby 
  the Orcs had been bred from captured Quendi many ages before: see the 
commentary on AAm §127 (p.   123) / Fr.162b/.

<BR> This text, entitled Melkor with Morgoth written 
beneath, is from the same collection as is text   III (found in a newspaper 
dated April 1959), and was written on four slips made from further copies 
  of the same Merton College documents dated June 1955 as is the draft A of 
the Athrabeth (pp.   350-2). The slip on which text III is written carries 
also preliminary drafting for the present   essay on Melkor.   It is 
notable that text VI begins with a reference to 'Finrod and Andreth', which was 
therefore in   existence, at least in some form.  <BR> Melkor Morgoth 
<BR> Melkor must be made far more powerful in original nature (cf. 'Finrod and 
Andreth'). The greatest   power under Eru (sc. the greatest created power) 
(1). (He was to make/ devise / begin; Manwe (a   little less great) was to 
improve, carry out, complete.) <BR> Later, he must not be able to be controlled 
or 'chained' by all the Valar combined. Note that in   the early age of Arda 
he was alone able to drive the Valar out of Middle-earth into retreat.   The 
war against Utumno was only undertaken by the Valar with reluctance, and without 
hope of real   victory, but rather as a covering action or diversion, to 
enable them to get the Quendi out of his   sphere of influence. But Melkor 
had already pro-gressed some way towards becoming 'the Morgoth, a   tyrant 
(or central tyranny and will), + his agents'. (2) Only the total contained the 
old power of   the complete Melkor; so that if 'the Morgoth' could be reached 
or temporarily separated from his   agents he was much more nearly 
controllable and on a power-level with the Valar. The Valar find   that they 
can deal with his agents (sc. armies, Balrogs, etc.) piecemeal. So that they 
come at last   to Utumno itself and find that 'the Morgoth' has no longer for 
the moment sufficient 'force' (in   any sense) to shield himself from direct 
personal contact. Manwe at last faces Melkor again, as he   has not done 
since he entered Arda. Both are amazed: Manwe to perceive the decrease in Melkor 
as a   person, Melkor to perceive this also from his own point of view: he 
has now less personal force   than Manwe, and can no longer daunt him with 
his gaze.   Either Manwe must tell him so or he must himself suddenly realize 
(or both) that this has   happened: he is 'dispersed'. But the lust to have 
creatures under him, dominated, has become   habitual and necessary to 
Melkor, so that even if the process was reversible (possibly was by 
  absolute and unfeigned self-abasement and repentance only) he cannot bring 
himself to do it.* As   with all other characters there must be a trembling 
moment when it is in the balance: he nearly   repents - and does not, and 
becomes much wickeder, and more foolish. <BR> Possibly (and he thinks it 
possible) he could now at that moment be humiliated against his own   will 
and 'chained' - if and before his dispersed forces reassemble. So - as soon as 
he has mentally   rejected repentance - he (just like Sauron after-wards on 
this model) makes a mockery of   self-abasement and repentance. From which 
actually he gets a kind of perverted pleasure as in   desecrating something 
holy - [for the mere contemplating of the possibility of genuine repentance, 
  if that did not come specially then as a direct grace from Eru, was at 
least one last flicker of   his true primeval nature.] (3). He feigns remorse 
and repentance. He actually kneels before Manwe   and surrenders - in the 
first instance to avoid being chained by the Chain Angainor, which once 
  upon him he fears would not ever be able to be shaken off. But also 
suddenly he has the idea of   penetrating the vaunted fastness of Valinor, 
and ruining it. So he offers to become 'the least of   the Valar' and servant 
of them each and all, to help (in advice and skill) in repairing all the 
  evils and hurts he has done. It is this offer which seduces or deludes 
Manwe - Manwe must be shown   to have his own inherent fault (though not 
sin):** he has become engrossed (partly out of sheer   fear of Melkor, partly 
out of desire to control him) in amendment, healing, re-ordering - even 
  'keeping the status quo' - to the loss of all creative power and even to 
weakness in dealing with   difficult and perilous situations. Against the 
advice of some of the Valar (such as Tulkas) he   grants Melkor's prayer. 
  Melkor is taken back to Valinor going last (save for Tulkas*** who follows 
bearing Angainor and   clinking it to remind Melkor).   But at the council 
Melkor is not given immediate freedom. The Valar in assembly will not tolerate 
  this. Melkor is remitted to Mandos (to stay there in 'reclusion' and 
meditate, and complete his   repentance - and also his plans for redress).(4) 
<BR> Then he begins to doubt the wisdom of his own policy, and would have 
rejected it all and burst out   into flaming rebellion - but he is now 
absolutely isolated from his agents and in enemy territory.   He cannot. 
Therefore he swallows the bitter pill (but it greatly increases his hate, and he 
ever   afterward accused Manwe of being faithless). 
<BR>The rest of the 
story, with Melkor's release, and permission to attend the Council sitting at 
the   feet of Manwe (after the pattern of evil counsellors in later tales, 
which it could be said derive   from this primeval model?), can then proceed 
more or less as already told. 
<BR>In this short essay it is seen that in his 
reflections on the nature of Melkor, the vastness of   his primeval power and 
its 'dispersion', my father had been led to propose certain important 
  alterations in the narrative of the legends as told in the Quenta 
Silmarillion (pp. 161, 186) and   in the Annals of Aman (pp. 75, 80, 93). In 
the narrative as it stood, and as it remained, (5) there   was no suggestion 
that Melkor feigned repentance when (no longer able to 'daunt him with his 
gaze')   he faced Manwe in Utumno - already harbouring 'the idea of 
penetrating the vaunted fastness of   Valinor, and ruining it'. On the 
contrary, 'Tulkas stood forth as the champion of the Valar and   wrestled 
with him and cast him upon his face, and bound him with the chain Angainor' (6) 
(an   ancient element, going back to the richly pictorial and 'primitive' 
account in the story of 'The Chaining of Melko' in The Book of Lost Tales, 
I.100-4). Moreover, in the present text it was now,   defeated at Utumno, 
that Melkor offered to become 'the least of the Valar', and to aid them in the 
  redress of all the evils that he had brought to pass, whereas in the 
narratives he did this when he   came before the Valar after he had endured 
the ages of his incarcera-tion in Mandos and sued for   pardon. Of Manwe it 
was said, when Melkor was allowed to go freely about Valinor, that he believed 
  that his evil was cured: 'for he himself was free from the evil and could 
not comprehend it'. No   such flaw or 'inherent fault' in Manwe as is 
described in this essay was suggested; (7) although it   was told that Ulmo, 
and Tulkas, doubted the wisdom of such clemency (and this too is an element 
  that goes back to The Book of Lost Tales: 'Such was the doom of Manwe ... 
albeit Tulkas and   Palurien thought it merciful to peril' (I.105)). 
<BR> *[footnote to the text] One of the reasons for his self-weakening is that 
he has given to his   'creatures', Orcs, Balrogs, etc. power of recuperation 
and multiplication. So that they will gather   again without further specific 
orders. Part of his native creative power has gone out into making   an 
independent evil growth out of his control. 
<BR> ** [footnote to the text] Every 
finite creature must have some weakness: that is some inadequacy   to deal 
with some situations. It is not sinful when not willed, and when the creature 
does his best   (even if it is not what should be done) as he sees it - with 
the conscious intent of serving Eru. 
<BR>***[footnote to the text] Tulkas 
represents the good side of 'violence' in the war against evil.   This is an 
absence of all compromise which will even face apparent evils (such as war) 
rather than   parley; and does not (in any kind of pride) think that any one 
less than Eru can redress this, or   rewrite the tale of Arda.

the idea of the 'dispersion' of Melkor's original power is found   in the 
Annals of Aman §179 (p. 133): For as he grew in malice, and sent forth from 
himself the evil   that he conceived in lies and creatures or wickedness, his 
power passed into them and was   dispersed, and he himself became ever more 
earth-bound, unwilling to issue from his dark   strongholds. Cf. also Annals

rewriting of Chapter 6: see p. 273, §48. But though :he changed text 
  introduced the ideas that any complete reversal of the evils brought about 
by Melkor was   impossible, and that be was 'in his beginning the greatest of 
the Powers', the narrative was not   altered in respect of changes envisaged 
in this essay (see note 7). 
<BR>Note 6. Alteration to the old story of the 
encounter at Utumno might have entered if QS Chapter 3   (in which this is 
recounted) had formed a part of the late rewriting that transformed the old 
  Chapter 6; but see note 7. 
 <BR>Note 7. In the final rewriting of QS 
Chapter 6 (p. 273, §48) this remained the case (note 5); 
and   the original story was also retained that it was in Valinor after his 
imprisonment, not at Utumno,   that Melkor made his promises of service and 
reparation. This might suggest that the present essay   was written after the 
new work on QS (almost certainly dating from the end of the 1950s, p. 300), 
  supporting the idea that the date of the documents on which the essay was 
written (1955) is   misleading (see p. 385).

<BR> MR (HME 10)/5:7. Myths Transformed. Notes on motives in the Silmarillion. /Autocomm./   
<BR> VII 
<BR> This essay is found in two forms. The earlier ('A') is a 
fairly brief text of four pages in   manuscript, titled 'Some notes on the 
"philosophy" of the Silmarillion' it is rapidly expressed and   does not have 
a clear ending. The second ('B') is a greatly expanded version of twelve pages, 
also   in manuscript, of far more careful expression and beginning in fine 
script, but breaking off   unfinished, indeed in the middle of a sentence. 
This is titled 'Notes on motives in the   Silmarillion'.   The relation 
between the two forms is such that for most of its length there is no need to 
give   any of the text of A, for all of its content is found embedded in B. 
From the point (p. 401) where   the Valar are condemned for the raising of 
the Pelori, however, the texts diverge. In B my father   introduced a long 
palliation of the conduct of the Valar, and the essay breaks off before the 
  matter of the concluding section of A was reached (see note 6); this is 
therefore given at the end of B.
<BR>The text of B was subsequently divided and lettered as three distinct sections, here numbered (i),   (ii), and (iii).
<BR>Notes on motives in the Silmarillion 
<BR>(i)<BR>Sauron was 'greater', effectively, in the Second Age than Morgoth at the end of the First. 
Why? 
<BR>Because, though he was far smaller by natural stature, he had not yet 
fallen so low. Eventually he also squandered his power (of being) in the 
endeavour to gain control of others. But he was not obliged to expend so 
much of himself. To gain domination over Arda, Morgoth had let most of his 
being pass into the physical constituents of the Earth - hence all things 
that were born on Earth and lived on and by it, beasts or plants or 
incarnate spirits, were liable to be 'stained'. Morgoth at the time of the 
War of the Jewels had become permanently 'incarnate': for this reason he was 
afraid, and waged the war almost entirely by means of devices, or of 
subordinates and dominated creatures. 
<BR>Sauron, however, inherited the 'corruption' of Arda, and only spent his (much more limited) power  on the Rings; for it was the creatures of earth, in their minds and wills, that he 
desired to dominate. In this way Sauron was also wiser than Melkor-Morgoth. 
Sauron was not a beginner of discord; and he probably knew more of the 
'Music' than did Melkor, whose mind had always been filled with his own 
plans and devices, and gave little attention to other things. The time of 
Melkor's greatest power, therefore, was in the physical beginnings of the 
World; a vast demiurgic lust for power and the achievement of his own will 
and designs, on a great scale. And later after things had become more 
stable, Melkor was more interested in and capable of dealing with a volcanic 
  eruption, for example, than with (say) a tree. It is indeed probable that 
he was simply unaware of   the minor or more delicate productions of Yavanna: 
such as small flowers. * 
<BR>Thus, as 'Morgoth', when Melkor was confronted by 
the existence of other inhabitants of Arda, with   other wills and 
intelligences, he was enraged by the mere fact of their existence, and his only 
  notion of dealing with them was by physical force, or the fear of it. His 
sole ultimate object was   their destruction. Elves, and still more Men, he 
despised because of their 'weakness': that is   their lack of physical force, 
or power over 'matter'; but he was also afraid of them. He was aware,   at 
any rate originally when still capable of rational thought, that he could not 
'annihilate'**   them: that is, destroy their being; but their physical 
life', and incarnate form became   increasingly to his mind the only thing 
that was worth considering. *** Or he became so far   advanced in Lying that 
he lied even to himself, and pretended that he could destroy them and rid 
  Arda of them altogether. Hence his endeavour always to break wills and 
subordinate them to or   absorb them into his own will and being, before 
destroying their bodies. This was sheer nihilism,   and negation its one 
ultimate object: Morgoth would no doubt, if he had been victorious, have 
  ultimately destroyed even his own 'creatures', such as the Orcs, when they 
had served his sole   purpose in using them: the destruction of Elves and 
Men. Melkor's final impotence and despair lay   in this: that whereas the 
Valar (and in their degree Elves and Men) could still love 'Arda Marred', 
  that is Arda with a Melkor-ingredient, and could still heal this or that 
hurt, or produce from its   very marring, from its state as it was, things 
beautiful and lovely, Melkor could do nothing with   Arda, which was not from 
his own mind and was interwoven with the work and thoughts of others: even 
  left alone he could only have gone raging on till all was levelled again 
into a formless chaos. And   yet even so he would have been defeated, because 
it would still have 'existed' independent of his   own mind, and a world in 
potential. <BR>Sauron had never reached this stage of nihilistic madness. He 
did not object to the existence of   the world, so long as he could do what 
he liked with it. He still had the relics of positive  purposes, that 
descended from the good of the nature in which he began: it had been his virtue 
(and   therefore also the cause of his fall, and of his relapse) that he 
loved order and co-ordination,   and disliked all confusion and wasteful 
friction.(It was the apparent will and power of Melkor to   effect his 
designs quickly and masterfully that had first attracted Sauron to him.) Sauron 
had, in   fact, been very like Saruman, and so still understood him quickly 
and could guess what he would be   likely to think and do, even without the 
aid of palantiri or of spies; whereas Gandalf eluded and   puzzled him. But 
like all minds of this cast, Sauron's love (originally) or (later) mere 
  understanding of other individual intelligences was correspondingly weaker; 
and though the only   real good in, or rational motive for, all this ordering 
and planning and organization was the good   of all inhabitants of Arda (even 
admitting Sauron's right to be their supreme lord), his 'plans',   the idea 
coming from his own isolated mind, became the sole object of his will, and an 
end, the   End, in itself. **** 
<BR>Morgoth had no 'plan': unless 
destruction and reduction to nil of a world in which he had only a   share 
can be called a 'plan'. But this is, of course, a simplification of the 
situation. Sauron had   not served Morgoth, even in his last stages, without 
becoming infected by his lust for destruction,   and his hatred of God (which 
must end in nihilism). Sauron could not, of course, be a 'sincere'   atheist. 
Though one of the minor spirits created before the world, he knew Eru, according 
to his   measure. He probably deluded himself with the notion that the Valar 
(including Melkor) having   failed, Eru had simply abandoned Eд, or at any 
rate Arda, and would not concern himself with it any   more. It would appear 
that he interpreted the 'change of the world' at the Downfall of Numenor, 
  when Aman was removed from the physical world, in this sense: Valar (and 
Elves) were removed from   effective control, and Men under God's curse and 
wrath. If he thought about the Istari, especially   Saruman and Gandalf, he 
imagined them as emissaries from the Valar, seeking to establish their lost 
  power again and 'colonize' Middle-earth, as a mere effort of defeated 
imperialists (without   knowledge or sanction of Eru). His cynicism, which 
(sincerely) regarded the motives of Manwe as   precisely the same as his own, 
seemed fully justified in Saruman. Gandalf he did not understand.   But 
certainly he had already become evil, and therefore stupid, enough to imagine 
that his   different behaviour was due simply to weaker intelligence and lack 
of firm masterful purpose. He   was only a rather cleverer Radagast - 
cleverer, because it is more profitable (more productive of   power) to 
become absorbed in the study of people than of animals.  
<BR>Sauron was not a 
'sincere' atheist, but he preached atheism, because it weakened resistance to 
  himself (and he had ceased to fear God's action in Arda). As was seen in 
the case of Ar-Pharazфn.   But there was seen the effect of Melkor upon 
Sauron: he spoke of Melkor in Melkor's own terms: as a   god, or even as God. 
This may have been the residue of a state which was in a sense a shadow of 
  good: the ability once in Sauron at least to admire or admit the 
superiority of a being other than   himself. Melkor, and still more Sauron 
himself afterwards, both profited by this darkened shadow of   good and the 
services of 'worshippers'. But it may be doubted whether even such a shadow of 
good   was still sincerely operative in Sauron by that time. His cunning 
motive is probably best expressed   thus. To wean one of the God-fearing from 
their allegiance it is best to propound another unseen   object of allegiance 
and another hope of benefits; propound to him a Lord who will sanction what he 
  desires and not forbid it. Sauron, apparently a defeated rival for 
world-power, now a mere hostage,   can hardly propound himself; but as the 
former servant and disciple of Melkor, the worship of   Melkor will raise him 
from hostage to high priest. But though Sauron's whole true motive was the 
  destruction of the Numenoreans, this was a particular matter of revenge 
upon Ar-Pharazon, for humiliation. Sauron (unlike Morgoth) would have been 
content for the Nъmenуreans to exist, as his   own subjects, and indeed he 
used a great many of them that he corrupted to his allegiance.     
<BR>* [footnote to the text] If such things were forced upon his attention, he was 
angry and hated them, as coming from other minds than his own. 
<BR>** [bracketed note inserted into the text] Melkor could not, of course, 
'annihilate' anything of matter, he could only ruin or destroy or corrupt 
the forms given to matter by other minds in their   subcreative activities. 
<BR>*** [footnote without indication of reference in the text] For this reason 
he himself came to fear 'death' - the destruction of his assumed bodily 
form - above everything, and sought to avoid any   kind injury to his own 
form. 
<BR>**** [Footnote to the text] But his capability of corrupting other 
minds, and even engaging their   service, was a residue from the fact that 
his original desire for 'order' had really envisaged the   good estate, 
specially physical well-being) of his 'subjects'.   No one, not even one of 
the Valar, can read the mind of other 'equal beings': * that is one cannot 
  'see' them or comprehend them fully and directly by simple inspection. One 
can deduce much of their   thought, from general comparisons leading to 
conclusions concerning the nature and tendencies of   minds and thought, and 
from particular knowledge of individuals, and special circumstances. But 
  this is no more reading or inspection of another mind than is deduction 
concerning the contents of   a closed room, or events taken place out of 
sight. Neither is so-called 'thought-transference' a process of 
mind-reading: this is but the reception, and interpretation by the receiving 
mind, of   the impact of a thought, or thought-pattern, emanating from 
another mind, which is no more the mind   in full or in itself than is the 
distant sight of a man running the man himself. Minds can exhibit or reveal 
themselves to other minds by the action of their own wills (though it is 
doubtful if,   even when willing or desiring this, a mind can actually reveal 
itself wholly to any other mind). It   is thus a temptation to minds of 
greater power to govern or constrain the will of other, and   weaker, minds, 
so as to induce or force them to reveal themselves. But to force such a 
revelation,   or to induce it by any lying or deception, even for supposedly 
'good' purposes (including the   'good' of the person so persuaded or 
dominated), is absolutely forbidden. To do so is a crime, and   the 'good' in 
the purposes of those who commit this crime swiftly becomes corrupted. Much 
could   thus 'go on behind Manwe's back': indeed the innermost being of all 
other minds, great and small,   was hidden from him. And with regard to the 
Enemy, Melkor, in particular, he could not penetrate by   distant mind-sight 
his thought and purposes, since Melkor remained in a fixed and powerful will to 
  withhold his mind: which physically expressed took shape in the darkness 
and shadows that   surrounded him. But Manwe could of course use, and did 
use, his own great knowledge his vast   experience of things and of persons, 
his memory of the 'Music', and his own far sight, and the   tidings of his 
messengers.   He, like Melkor, practically never is seen or heard of outside 
or far away from his own halls and   permanent residence. Why is this? For no 
very profound reason. The Government is always in   Whitehall. King Arthur is 
usually in Camelot or Caerleon and news and adventures come there and   arise 
there. The 'Elder King' is obviously not going to be finally defeated or 
destroyed at least   not before some ultimate 'Ragnarek' (1) - which even for 
us is still in the future, so he can have   no real 'adventures'. But if you 
keep him at home, the issue of any particular event (since it   cannot then 
result in a final 'checkmate') can remain in literary suspense. Even to the 
final war   against Morgoth it is Fionwe son of Manwe who leads out the power 
of the Valar. When we move out   Manwe it will be the last battle, and the 
end of the World (or of 'Arda Marred') as the Eldar would   say. 
<BR> [Morgoth's staying 'at home' has, as described above, quite a different 
reason: his fear of being   killed or even hurt (the literary motive is not 
present, for since he is pitted against the Elder   King, the issue of any 
one of his enterprises is always in doubt).]   Melkor 'incarnated' himself 
(as Morgoth) permanently. He did this so as to control the <i>hroa</i>,(2)   the 
'flesh' or physical matter of Arda. He attempted to identify himself with it. A 
vaster and more   perilous, procedure, though of similar sort to the 
operations of Sauron with the Rings. Thus,   outside the Blessed Realm, all 
'matter' was likely to have a 'Melkor ingredient', (3) and those who   had 
bodies, nourished by the <i>hroa</i> of Arda, had as it were a tendency, small or 
great, towards   Melkor: they were none of them wholly free of him in their 
incarnate form, and their bodies had an   effect upon their spirits. <BR> But 
in this way Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater part of his 
original 'angelic' powers, of mind and spirit, while gaining a terrible 
grip upon the physical world. For this reason he had to be fought, mainly 
by physical force, and enormous material ruin was a probable consequence of 
any direct combat with him, victorious or otherwise. This is the chief 
explanation of the constant reluctance of the Valar to come into open 
battle against Morgoth. 
<BR>Manwe's task and problem was much more difficult 
than Gandalf's. Sauron's, relatively smaller,   power was concentrated; 
Morgoth's vast power was disseminated. The whole of 'Middle-earth' was 
Morgoth's Ring, though temporarily his attention was mainly upon the 
North-west. Unless swiftly   successful, War against him might well end in 
reducing all Middle-earth to chaos, possibly even all   Arda. It is easy to 
say: 'It was the task and function of the Elder King to govern Arda and make it 
  possible for the Children of Eru to live in it unmolested.' But the dilemma 
of the Valar was this:   Arda could only be liberated by a physical battle; 
but a probable result of such a battle was the   irretrievable ruin of Arda. 
Moreover, the final eradication of Sauron (as a power directing evil)   was 
achievable by the destruction of the Ring. No such eradication of Morgoth was 
possible, since   this required the complete disintegration of the 'matter' 
of Arda. Sauron's power was not (for   example) in gold as such, but in a 
particular form or shape made of a particular portion of total   gold. 
Morgoth's power was disseminated throughout Gold, if nowhere absolute (for he 
did not create   Gold) it was nowhere absent. (It was this Morgoth-element in 
matter, indeed, which was a   prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils 
as Sauron practised with it and upon it.)   It is quite possible, of course, 
that certain 'elements' or conditions of matter had attracted   Morgoth's 
special attention (mainly, unless in the remote past, for reasons of his own 
plans). For   example, all gold (in Middle-earth) seems to have had a 
specially 'evil' trend - but not silver.   Water is represented as being 
almost entirely free of Morgoth. (This, of course, does not mean that   any 
particular sea, stream, river, well, or even vessel of water could not be 
poisoned or defiled -   as all things could.) 
<BR>* [marginal note] All 
rational minds / spirits deriving direct from Eru are 'equal' -- in order 
and status - though not necessarily 'coлval' or of like original power. 
<BR>Note 1. Ragnarok: 'the Doom of the Gods' (Old Norse): see IX.286. 
<BR>Note 2. hroa: so written here and at the second occurrence below (and in 
text A), not as elsewhere always <em>hroa</em>, where it means the body of an 
incarnate being. The word used for 'physical matter' in   Laws and Customs 
was hron, later changed to orma (p. 2 18 and note 26); in the Commentary on the 
  Athrabeth and in the 'Glossary' of names the word is <em>erma</em> (pp. 338, 349). 
<BR> Note 3. On this sentence see p. 271. <BR> (iii)   <BR> The Valar 'fade' and 
become more impotent, precisely in proportion as the shape and constitution 
  of things becomes more defined and settled. The longer the Past, the more 
nearly defined the   Future, and the less room for important change 
(untrammelled action, on a physical plane, that is   not destructive in 
purpose). The Past, once 'achieved', has become part of the 'Music in being'. 
<BR> Only Eru may or can alter the 'Music'. The last major effort, of this 
demiurgic kind, made by the   Valar was the lifting up of the range of the 
Pelori to a great height. It is possible to view this   as, if not an 
actually bad action, at least as a mistaken one. Ulmo disapproved of it. (1) It 
had   one good, and legitimate, object: the preservation incorrupt of at 
least a part of Arda. But it   seemed to have a selfish or neglectful (or 
despairing) motive also; for the effort to preserve the   Elves incorrupt 
there had proved a failure if they were to be left free: many had refused to 
come   to the Blessed Realm, many had revolted and left it. Whereas, with 
regard to Men, Manwe and all the   Valar knew quite well that they could not 
come to Aman at all; and the longevity (co-extensive with   the life of Arda) 
of Valar and Eldar was expressly not permitted to Men. Thus the 'Hiding of 
  Valinor' came near to countering Morgoth's possessiveness by a rival 
possessiveness, setting up a   private domain of light and bliss against one 
of darkness and domination: a palace and a pleasaunce   (2) (well-fenced) 
against a fortress and a dungeon. (3)   This appearance of selfish fainйance 
in the Valar in the mythology as told is (though I have not   explained it or 
commented on it) I think only an 'appearance', and one which we are apt to 
accept   as the truth, since we are all in some degree affected by the shadow 
and lies of their Enemy, the   Calumniator. It has to be remembered that the 
'mythology' is repre-sented as being two stages   removed from a true record: 
it is based first upon Elvish records and lore about the Valar and   their 
own dealings with them; and these have reached us (fragmentarily) only through 
relics of   Numenorean (human) traditions, derived from the Eldar, in the 
earlier parts, though for later times   supplemented by anthropocentric 
histories and tales. (4) These, it is true, came down through the 
  'Faithful' and their descendants in Middle-earth, but could not altogether 
escape the darkening of   the picture due to the hostility of the rebellious 
Nъmenуreans to the Valar.   Even so, and on the grounds of the stories as 
received, it is possible to view the matter   otherwise. The closing of 
Valinor against the rebel Noldor (who left it voluntarily and after 
  warning) was in itself just. But, if we dare to attempt to enter the mind 
of the Elder King,   assigning motives and finding faults, there are things 
to remember before we deliver a judgement.   Manwe was the spirit of greatest 
wisdom and prudence in Arda. He is represented as having had the   greatest 
knowledge of the Music, as a whole, possessed by any one finite mind; and he 
alone of all   persons or minds in that time is represented as having the 
power of direct recourse to and   communication with Eru. He must have 
grasped with great clarity what even we may perceive dimly:   that it was the 
essential mode of the process of 'history' in Arda that evil should constantly 
  arise, and that out of it new good should constantly come. One especial 
aspect of this is the   strange way in which the evils of the Marrer, or his 
inheritors, are turned into weapons against   evil. If we consider the 
situation after the escape of Morgoth and the reestablish-ment of his   abode 
in Middle-earth, we shall see that the heroic Noldor were the best possible 
weapon with which   to keep Morgoth at bay, virtually besieged, and at any 
rate fully occupied, on the northern fringe   of Middle-earth, without 
provoking him to a frenzy of nihilistic destruction. And in the meanwhile, 
  Men, or the best elements in Mankind, shaking off his shadow, came into 
contact with a people who   had actually seen and experi-enced the Blessed 
Realm.   In their association with the warring Eldar Men were raised to their 
fullest achievable stature,   and by the two marriages the transference to 
them, or infusion into Mankind, of the noblest   Elf-strain was accomplished, 
in readiness for the still distant, but inevitably approaching, days   when 
the Elves would 'fade'. <BR> The last intervention with physical force by the 
Valar, ending in the breaking of Thangorodrim,   may then be viewed as not in 
fact reluctant or even unduly delayed, but timed with precision. The 
  intervention came before the annihilation of the Eldar and the Edain. 
Morgoth though locally   triumphant had neglected most of Middle-earth during 
the war; and by it he had in fact been   weakened: in power and prestige (he 
had lost and failed to recover one of the Silmarils), and above   all in 
mind. He had become absorbed in 'kingship', and though a tyrant of ogre-size and 
monstrous   power, this was a vast fall even from his former wickedness of 
hate, and his terrible nihilism. He   had fallen to like being a tyrant-king 
with conquered slaves, and vast obedient armies. (5)   The war was 
successful, and ruin was limited to the small (if beautiful) region of 
Beleriand.   Morgoth was thus actually made captive in physical form, (6) and 
in that form taken as a mere   criminal to Aman and delivered to Namo Mandos 
as judge - and executioner. He was judged, and   eventually taken out of the 
Blessed Realm and executed: that is killed like one of the Incarnates.   It 
was then made plain (though it must have been understood beforehand by Manwe and 
Namo) that,   though he had 'disseminated' his power (his evil and possessive 
and rebellious will) far and wide   into the matter of Arda, he had lost 
direct control of this, and all that 'he', as a surviving   remnant of 
integral being, retained as 'himself and under control was the terribly shrunken 
and   reduced spirit that inhabited his self-imposed (but now beloved) body. 
When that body was destroyed   he was weak and utterly 'houseless', and for 
that time at a loss and 'unanchored' as it were. We   read that he was then 
thrust out into the Void. (7) That should mean that he was put outside Time 
  and Space, outside Ea altogether; but if that were so this would imply a 
direct intervention of Eru   (with or without supplication of the Valar). It 
may however refer inaccurately* to the extrusion or   flight of his spirit 
from Arda.   In any case, in seeking to absorb or rather to infiltrate 
himself throughout 'matter', what was   then left of him was no longer 
powerful enough to reclothe itself. (It would now remain fixed in   the 
desire to do so: there was no 'repentance' or possibility of it: Melkor had 
abandoned for ever   all 'spiritual' ambitions, and existed almost solely as 
a desire to possess and dominate matter,   and Arda in particular.) At least 
it could not yet reclothe itself. We need not suppose that Manwe   was 
deluded into supposing that this had been a war to end war, or even to end 
Melkor. Melkor was   not Sauron. We speak of him being 'weakened, shrunken, 
reduced'; but this is in comparison with the great Valar. He had been a 
being of immense potency and life. The Elves certainly held and taught   that 
fear or 'spirits' may grow of their own life (independently of the body), even 
as they may be   hurt and healed, be diminished and renewed. (8) The dark spirit of 
Melkor's 'remainder' might be   expected, therefore, eventually and after 
long ages to increase again, even (as some held) to draw   back into itself 
some of its formerly dissipated power. It would do this (even if Sauron could 
not)   because of its relative greatness. It did not repent, or turn finally 
away from its obsession, but   retained still relics of wisdom, so that it 
could still seek its object indirectly, and not merely   blindly. It would 
rest, seek to heal itself, distract itself by other thoughts and desires and 
  devices - but all simply to recover enough strength to return to the attack 
on the Valar, and to   its old obsession. As it grew again it would become, 
as it were, a dark shadow, breeding on the   confines of Arda, and yearning 
towards it. <BR> Nonetheless the breaking of Thangorodrim and the extrusion of 
Melkor was the end of 'Morgoth' as   such, and for that age (and many ages 
after). It was thus, also, in a sense the end of Manwe's   prime function and 
task as Elder King, until the End. He had been the Adversary of the Enemy. 
<BR> It is very reasonable to suppose that Manwe knew that before long (as he 
saw 'time') the Dominion   of Men must begin, and the making of history would 
then be committed to them: for their struggle   with Evil special 
arrangements had been made! Manwe knew of Sauron, of course. He had commanded 
  Sauron to come before him for judgement, but had left room for repentance 
and ultimate   rehabilitation. Sauron had refused and had fled into hiding. 
Sauron, however, was a problem that   Men had to deal with finally: the first 
of the many concentrations of Evil into definite   power-points that they 
would have to combat, as it was also the last of those in 'mythological' 
  personalized (but non-human) form. 
 <BR> It may be noted that Sauron's first 
defeat was achieved by the Numenoreans alone (though Sauron   was not in fact 
overthrown personally: his 'captivity' was voluntary and a trick). In the first 
  overthrow and disembodiment of Sauron in Middle-earth (neglecting the 
matter of Luthien) (9) 
<BR> Here the long version B breaks off, at the foot of a 
page. I give now the conclusion of version A   from the point where the texts 
diverge (see p. 394 and note 6), beginning with the sentence   corresponding 
to B (p. 401) 'The last major effort, of this demiurgic kind, made by the 
Valar...'   The last effort of this sort made by the Valar was the raising up 
of the Pelori - but this was not   a good act: it came near to countering 
Morgoth in his own way - apart from the element of   selfishness in its 
object of preserving Aman as a blissful region to live in.   The Valar were 
like architects working with a plan 'passed' by the Government. They became less 
  and less important (structurally!) as the plan was more and more nearly 
achieved. Even in the First   Age we see them after uncounted ages of work 
near the end of their time of work - not wisdom or   counsel. (The wiser they 
became the less power they had to do anything - save by counsel.) <BR> Similarly 
the Elves faded, having introduced 'art and science'. (10) Men will also 'fade', 
if it   proves to be the plan that things shall still go on, when they have 
completed their function. But   even the Elves had the notion that this would 
not be so: that the end of Men would somehow be bound   up with the end of 
history, or as they called it 'Arda Marred' (Arda Sahta), and the achievement of 
  'Arda Healed' (Arda Envinyanta). (11) (They do not seem to have been clear 
or precise - how should   they be! - whether Arda Envinyanta was a permanent 
state of achievement, which could therefore only   be enjoyed 'outside Time', 
as it were: surveying the Tale as an englobed whole; or a state of   unmarred 
bliss within Time and in a 'place' that was in some sense a lineal and 
historical descent   of our world or 'Arda Marred'. They seem often to have 
meant both. 'Arda Unmarred' did not actually   exist, but remained in thought 
- Arda without Melkor, or rather without the effects of his becoming   evil; 
but is the source from which all ideas of order and perfection are derived. 
'Arda Healed' is   thus both the completion of the 'Tale of Arda' which has 
taken up all the deeds of Melkor, but must   according to the promise of 
Iluvatar be seen to be good; and also a state of redress and bliss   beyond 
the 'circles of the world'.) (12)   Evil is fissiparous. But itself barren. 
Melkor could not 'beget', or have any spouse (though he   attempted to ravish 
Arien, this was to destroy and 'distain' (13) her, not to beget fiery 
  offspring). Out of the discords of the Music - sc. not directly out of 
either of the themes, (14)   Eru's or Melkor's, but of their dissonance with 
regard one to another - evil things appeared in   Arda, which did not descend 
from any direct plan or vision of Melkor: they were not 'his children';   and 
therefore, since all evil hates, hated him too. The progeniture of things was 
corrupted. Hence   Orcs? Part of the Elf-Man idea gone wrong. Though as for 
Orcs, the Eldar believed Morgoth had   actually 'bred' them by capturing Men 
, (and Elves) early and increasing to the utmost any corrupt   tendencies 
they possessed.   Despite its incomplete state (whether due to the loss of 
the conclusion of the fully developed   form of the essay or to its 
abandonment, see note 6) this is the most comprehensive account that my 
  father wrote of how, in his later years, he had come to 'interpret' the 
nature of Evil in his   mythology; never elsewhere did he write any such 
exposition of the nature of Morgoth, of his   decline, and of his corruption 
of Arda, nor draw out the distinction between Morgoth and Sauron:   'the 
whole of Middle-earth was Morgoth's Ring'. 
<BR>To place this essay in 
sequential relation to the other 'philosophical' or 'theological' writings 
given in this book with any certainty seems scarcely possible, though 
'Fionwe son of Manwe' on p. 399 (for 'Eonwe herald of Manwe') may suggest 
that it stands relatively early among them (see pp. 151-2). It shows a 
marked likeness in tone to the many letters of exposition that my father wrote 
in the later 1950s, and indeed it seems to me very possible that the 
correspondence which followed the publication of The Lord of the Rings 
played a significant part in the development of his examination of the 
'images and events' of the mythology. (15).     
<BR>*[footnote to the text] 
Since the minds of Men (and even of the Elves) were inclined to confuse   the 
'Void', as a conception of the state of Not-being, outside Creation or Ea, with 
the conception   of vast spaces within Ea, especially those conceived to lie 
all about the enisled 'Kingdom of Arda'   (which we should probably call the 
Solar System).     
<BR>Note 1. Overt condemnation, strongly expressed, of 
the Valar for the Hiding of Valinor is found in   the story of that name in 
The Book of Lost Tales (I.208-9), but disappears in the later versions.   Of 
the old story I noted (I.223) that 'in The Silmarillion there is no vestige of 
the tumultuous   council, no suggestion of a disagreement among the Valar, 
with Manwe, Varda and Ulmo actively disapproving the work and holding aloof 
from it', and I commented: It is most curious to observe that the action of 
the Valar here sprang essentially from indolence mixed with fear. Nowhere 
does my father's early conception of the fainйant Gods appear more   clearly. 
He held moreover quite explicitly that their failure to make war upon Melko then 
and there   was a deep error, diminishing themselves, and (as it appears) 
irreparable. In his later writing the   Hiding of Valinor remained indeed, 
but only as a great fact of mythological antiquity; there is no   whisper of 
its condemnation. 
<BR>The last words refer to the actual Silmarillion 
narratives. Ulmo's disapproval now reappears, and   is a further evidence of 
his isolation in the counsels of the Valar (see p. 253 note II); cf. his 
words to Tuor at Vinyamar (having spoken to him, among other things, of 
'the hiding of the Blessed Realm', though what he said is not told): 
'Therefore, though in the days of this darkness I seem to   oppose the will 
of my brethren, the Lords of the West, that is my part among them, to which I 
was   appointed ere the making of the World' {Unfinished Tales p. 29). 
<BR>Note 2. pleasaunce (= pleasance): a 'pleasure-garden'. My father used this 
word several times in   The Book of Lost Tales (see 1.275, pleasance), for 
example of the gardens of Lorien.
<BR>Note 3. At this point my father wrote 
on the manuscript later: 'See original short form on Fading   of Elves (and 
Men)'. See p. 394. This seems a clear indication that B was not completed, or 
that if   it was its conclusion was early lost.
<BR>Note 4. Cf. the 
statement on this subject in the brief text I, p. 370.
<BR>Note 5. Since this 
discussion is introduced in justification of the Hiding of Valinor, the bearing 
  of the argument seems to be that the history of Middle-earth in the last 
centuries of the First Age would not have been possible of achievement had 
Valinor remained open to the return of the Noldor. 
<BR>Note 6. As, of course, had happened to Melkor long before, after the sack of Utumno. 
<BR>Note 7. Cf. the conclusion of QS (V.332, §29): 'But Morgoth himself the Gods thrust through the Door of Night into the Timeless Void, beyond the Walls of the World'. 
<BR>Note 8. The following was added marginally after the page was written:   
If they do not sink below a certain level. Since no fea can be annihilated, 
reduced to zero or not-existing, it is no clear what is meant. Thus Sauron 
was said to have fallen below the point of ever recovering, though he had 
previously recovered. What is probably meant is that a 'wicked' spirit 
becomes fixed in a certain desire or ambition, and if it cannot repent then this 
desire becomes virtually its whole being. But the desire may be wholly 
beyond the weakness it has fallen to, and it will then be unable to 
withdraw its attention from the unobtainable desire, even to   attend to 
itself. It will then remain for ever in impotent desire or memory of desire. 
<BR>Note 9. A reference to the legend of the defeat of Sauron by Luthien and 
Huan on the isle of   Tol-in-Gaurhoth, where Beren was imprisoned {The 
Silmarillion pp. 174-5).
<BR>Note 10. Cf. Letters no.181 (1956): 'In this mythological world the Elves and Men are in their incarnate forms kindred, but in the relation of their "spirits" to the world in time represent different "experiments", each of which has its own natural trend, and weakness. The Elves represent, as it were, the artistic, aesthetic, and purely scientific aspects of the Humane nature   raised to a higher level than is actually seen in Men.'
<BR>Note 11. In the text FM 2 of 'Finwe and Miriel' (p. 254, footnote) 'Arda Marred' is Arda Hastaina. Arda Envinyanta, at both occurrences, was first written Arda Vincarna. 
<BR>Note 12. With this passage in brackets cf. especially note (iii) at the end of Laws and Customs (p. 251); also pp. 245,254 (footnote), 318 
<BR>Note 13. distain', an archaic verb meaning 'stain', 'discolour', 'defile'.  
<BR>Note 14. The Three Themes of Iluvatar in the Music of the Ainur are here treated as a single theme, in opposition to the discordant 'theme' of Melkor. 
<BR>Note 15. In a letter of June 1957 (Letters no.200) he wrote: I am sorry if this all seems dreary and 'pompose'. But so do all attempts to 'explain' the images and events of a mythology. Naturally the stories come first. But it is, I 
suppose, some test of the consistency of a mythology as such, if it is 
capable of some sort of rational or rationalized explanation.

<BR> MR (HME 10)/5:8. Myths Transformed. Orcs. /Autocomm./

<BR> VIII <BR> In the last sentence of the original short version of text VII 
(p. 406) my father wrote that the Eldar believed that Morgoth bred the Orcs 
'by capturing Men (and Elves) early' (i.e. in the early days of their 
existence). This indicates that his views on this subject had changed since the 
  Annals of Aman. For the theory of the origin of the Orcs as it stood, in 
point of written record in the narratives, (1) at this time see AAm §42-5 
(pp. 72-4, and commentary p. 78 /Fr.161/), and §127 (pp. 109-10 /Fr.162a/, and commentary pp. 123-4 /Fr.162 b/). In the final form in AAm (p. 74 
/Fr.161/) 'this is held true by the wise of Eressлa': all those of 
the Quendi that came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put 
there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty and wickedness were corrupted 
and enslaved. Thus did Melkor breed the hideous race of the Orkor in envy 
and mockery of the Eldar, of whom they were afterwards the bitterest foes. 
For the Orkor had life and multiplied after the manner of the Children of 
Iluvatar; and naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance thereof, 
could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the Ainulindale before the 
Beginning: so say the wise. On the typescript of AAm my father noted 
against the account of the origin of the Orcs: 'Alter this. Orcs are not 
Elvish' (p. 80) /Fr.161/. The present text, entitled 'Orcs', is a short 
essay (very much a record of 'thinking with the pen') found in the same 
small collection gathered in a newspaper of 1959 as texts III and VI. Like 
  them it was written on Merton College papers of 1955; and like text VI it 
makes reference to 'Finrod and Andreth' (see pp. 385, 390). <BR>Orcs 
<BR>Their nature and origin require more thought. They are not easy to work 
into the theory and system. <BR>(1) As the case of Aule and the Dwarves shows, 
only Eru could make creatures with independent wills, and with reasoning 
powers. But Orcs seem to have both: they can try to cheat Morgoth / Sauron, 
rebel against him, or criticize him. <BR>(2) ? Therefore they must be 
corruptions of something pre-existing. <BR>(3) But Men had not yet appeared, 
when the Orcs already existed. Aulл constructed the Dwarves out of his 
memory of the Music; but Eru would not sanction the work of Melkor so as to 
allow the   independence of the Orcs. (Not unless Orcs were ultimately 
remediable, or could be amended and 'saved'?) It also seems clear (see 
'Finrod and Andreth') that though Melkor could utterly corrupt and ruin 
  individuals, it is not possible to contemplate his absolute perversion of a 
whole people, or group of peoples, and his making that state heritable. (2) 
[Added later: This latter must (if a fact) be   an act of Eru.] <BR>In that 
case Elves, as a source, are very unlikely. And are Orcs 'immortal', in the 
Elvish sense? Or trolls? It seems clearly implied in The Lord of the Rings 
that trolls existed in their own   right, but were 'tinkered' with by Melkor. 
(3) 
<BR> (4) What of talking beasts and birds with reasoning and speech? These 
have been rather lightly adopted from less 'serious' mythologies, but play 
a part which cannot now be excised. They are certainly 'exceptions' and not 
much used, but sufficiently to show they are a recognized feature of   the 
world. All other creatures accept them as natural if not common. 
<BR>But true 'rational' creatures, 'speaking peoples', are all of human / 'humanoid' form. Only the Valar and Maiar are intelligences that can assume forms of Arda at will. Huan and Sorontar could be   Maiar - emissaries of Manwe. (4) But unfortunately in The Lord of the Rings Gwaehir and Landroval are said to 
be descendants of Sorontar. (5) In any case is it likely or possible that 
even the least of the Maiar would become Orcs? Yes: both outside Arda and 
in it, before the fall of Utumno. Melkor had corrupted many spirits - some 
great, as Sauron, or less so, as Balrogs. The least could have been 
primitive (and much more powerful and perilous) Orcs; but by practising 
when embodied procreation they would (cf. Melian) more and more 
  earthbound, unable to return to spirit-state (even demon-form), until 
released by death (killing), and they would dwindle in force. When released 
they would, of course, like Sauron, be 'damned':   i.e. reduced to impotence, 
infinitely recessive: still hating but unable more and more to make it 
  effective physically (or would not a very dwindled dead Orc-state be a 
poltergeist?). But again - would Eru provide <i>fear</i> for such creatures? For 
the Eagles etc. perhaps. But not for Orcs. (6) It does however seem 
best to view Melkor's corrupting power as always starting, at least, in the 
  moral or theological level. Any creature that took him for Lord (and 
especially those who   blasphemously called him Father or Creator) became 
soon corrupted in all parts of its being, the   <i>fea</i> dragging down the hroa in 
its descent into Morgothism: hate and destruction. As for Elves being 
  'immortal': they in fact only had enormously long lives, and were 
themselves physically 'wearing   out', and suffering a slow progressive 
weakening of their bodies. 
<BR>In summary: I think it must be assumed that 
'talking' is not necessarily the sign of the possession of a 'rational 
soul' or <i>fea</i>. (7) The Orcs were beasts of humanized shape (to mock Men   and 
Elves) deliberately perverted / converted into a more close resemblance to Men. 
Their 'talking'   was really reeling off 'records' set in them by Melkor. 
Even their rebellious critical words - he   knew about them. Melkor taught 
them speech and as they bred they inherited this; and they had just   as much 
independence as have, say, dogs or horses of their human masters. This talking 
was largely   echoic (cf. parrots), in The Lord of the Rings Sauron is said 
to have devised a language for them.  (8)  The same sort of thing may 
be said of Huan and the Eagles: they were taught language by the Valar,   and 
raised to a higher level - but they still had no <i>fear</i>.   But Finrod probably 
went too far in his assertion that Melkor could not wholly corrupt any work of 
  Eru, or that Eru would (necessarily) interfere to abrogate the corruption, 
or to end the being of   His own creatures because they had been corrupted 
and fallen into evil. (9)   It remains therefore terribly possible there was 
an Elvish strain in the Orcs. (10) These may then   even have been mated with 
beasts (sterile!) - and later Men. Their life-span would be diminished.   And 
dying they would go to Mandos and be held in prison till the End.   The text 
as written ends here, but my father subsequently added the following passage. 
The words   with which it opens are a reference to text VI, Melkor Morgoth 
(p. 390).   See 'Melkor'. It will there be seen that the wills of Orcs and 
Balrogs etc. are part of Melkor's   power 'dispersed'. Their spirit is one of 
hate. But hate is non-cooperative (except under direct   fear). Hence the 
rebellions, mutinies, etc. when Morgoth seems far off. Orcs are beasts and 
Balrogs   corrupted Maiar. Also (n.b.) Morgoth not Sauron is the source of 
Orc-wills. Sauron is just another   (if greater) agent. Orcs can rebel 
against him without losing their own irremediable allegiance to   evil 
(Morgoth). Aule wanted love. But of course had no thought of dispersing his 
power. Only Eru   can give love and independence. If a finite sub-creator 
tries to do this he really wants absolute   loving obedience, but it turns 
into robotic servitude and becomes evil.     
<BR>Note 1. In a long letter to 
Peter Hastings of September 1954, which was not sent (Letters no.l53),   my 
father wrote as follows on the question of whether Orcs 'could have "souls" or 
"spirits"':     ... since in my myth at any rate I do not conceive of the 
making of souls or spirits, things of an   equal order if not an equal power 
to the Valar, as a possible 'delegation', I have represented at   least the 
Orcs as pre-existing real beings on whom the Dark Lord has exerted the fullness 
of his   power in remodelling and corrupting them, not making them. ... There 
might be other 'makings' all   the same which were more like puppets filled 
(only at a distance) with their maker's mind and will,   or ant-like 
operating under direction of a queen-centre.     Earlier in this letter he 
had quoted Frodo's words to Sam in the chapter 'The Tower of Cirith   Ungol': 
'The Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of 
its own. I   don't think it gave life to the Orcs, it only ruined them and 
twisted them'; and he went on: 'In   the legends of the Elder Days it is 
suggested that the Diabolus subjugated and corrupted some of   the earliest 
Elves ...' He also said that the Orcs 'are fundamentally a race of "rational 
incarnate" creatures'. 
<BR>Note 2. in the Athrabeth (p. 312) Finrod 
declared: But never even in the night have we believed that  could 
prevail against the Children of Eru. This   one he might cozen, or that one 
he might corrupt; but to change the doom of a whole people of the   Children, 
to rob them of their inherit-ance: if he could do that in Eru's despite, then 
greater and   more terrible is he by far than we guessed .. <BR> Note 3. In 
The Lord of the Rings Appendix F (1) it is said of Trolls:     In their 
beginning far back in the twilight of the Elder Days, these were creatures of 
dull and   lumpish nature and had no more language than beasts. But Sauron 
had made use of them, teaching them   what little they could learn, and 
increasing their wits with wickedness.   In the long letter of September 1954 
cited in note I he wrote of them:   I am not sure about Trolls. I think they 
are mere 'counterfeits', and hence (though here I am of   course only using 
elements of old barbarous mythmaking that had no 'aware' metaphysic) they return 
  to mere stone images when not in the dark. But there are other sorts of 
Trolls beside these rather   ridiculous, if brutal. Stone-trolls, for which 
other origins are suggested. Of course ... when you   make Trolls speak you 
are giving them a power, which in our world (probably) connotes the 
  possession of a 'soul'. 
 <BR> Note 4. See p. 138.-At the bottom of the page 
bearing the brief text V (p. 389) my father jotted   down the following, 
entirely unconnected with the matter of the text:   Living things in Aman. As 
the Valar would robe themselves like the Children, many of the Maiar   robed 
themselves like other lesser living things, as trees, flowers, beasts. (Huan.) 
<BR> Note 5. 'There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, 
greatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of 
old Thorondor' ('The Field of Cormallen' in The Return of the King). 
<BR> Note 6. At this point there is a note that begins 'Criticism of (1) (2) (3) 
above' (i.e. the   opening points of this text, p. 409) and then refers 
obscurely to the last battle and fall of Barad-dur etc.' in The Lord of the 
Rings. In view of what follows my father was presumably thinking   of this 
passage in the chapter 'Mount Doom':   From all his policies and webs of fear 
and treachery, from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free; and 
throughout his realm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, 
and   his captains suddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. 
For they were forgotten.   
<BR> The note continues: They had little or no will when not actually 'attended to' by the mind of Sauron. Does their cheating and rebellion pass that possible to such animals as dogs etc.? 
<BR> Note 7. Cf. the end of the passage cited from the letter of 1954 m note 3. 
<BR> Note 8. Appendix F (I): 'It is said that the Black Speech was devised by 
Sauron in the Dark Years'. 
<BR> Note 9. See the citation from the Athrabeth in note 2. Finrod did not in fact assert the latter part of the opinion here attributed to him. 
<BR> Note 10. The assertion that 'it remains therefore 
terribly possible there was an Elvish strain in the Orcs' seems merely to 
contradict what has been said about their being no more than 'talking 
  beasts' without advancing any new considerations. In the passage added at 
the end of the text the   statement that 'Orcs are beasts' is repeated.

<BR>IX 
<BR> This is another and quite separate note on the origin of the 
Orcs, written quickly in pencil, and   without any indication of date. 
  This suggests - though it is not explicit - that the 'Orcs' were of Elvish 
origin. Their origin is   more clearly dealt with elsewhere. One point only 
is certain: Melkor could not 'create' living   'creatures' of independent 
wills.   He (and all the 'spirits' of the 'First-created', according to their 
measure) could assume bodily   shapes; and he (and they) could dominate the 
minds of other creatures, including Elves and Men, by   force, fear, or 
deceits, or sheer magnificence.   The Elves from their earliest times 
invented and used a word or words with a base (o)rok to denote   anything 
that caused fear and/or horror. It would originally have been applied to 
'phantoms'   (spirits assuming visible forms) as well as to any 
independ-ently existing creatures. Its   application (in all Elvish tongues) 
specifically to the creatures called Orks - so I shall spell it   in The 
Silmarillion - was later.   Since Melkor could not 'create' an independent 
species, but had immense powers of corruption and   distortion of those that 
came into his power, it is probable that these Orks had a mixed origin. 
  Most of them plainly (and biologically) were corruptions of Elves (and 
probably later also of Men).   But always among them (as special servants and 
spies of Melkor, and as leaders) there must have   been numerous corrupted 
minor spirits who assumed similar bodily shapes. (These would exhibit 
  terrifying and demonic characters.)   The Elves would have classed the 
creatures called 'trolls' (in The Hobbit and The Lord of the   Rings) as Orcs 
- in character and origin - but they were larger and slower. It would seem 
evident   that they were corruptions of primitive human types.   At the 
bottom of the page my father wrote: 'See The Lord of the Rings Appendix p. 410'; 
this is   the passage in Appendix F concerning Trolls.   It seems possible 
that his opening words in this note 'This suggests -though it is not explicit - 
  that the "Orcs" were of Elvish origin' actually refer to the previous text 
given here, VIII, where   he first wrote that 'Elves, as a source, are very 
unlikely', but later concluded that 'it remains   therefore terribly possible 
there was an Elvish strain in the Orcs'. But if this is so, the   following 
words 'Their origin is more clearly dealt with elsewhere' must refer to 
something else.   He now expressly asserts the earlier view (see p. 408 and 
note 1 / Fr.168/) that the Orcs were in   origin corrupted Elves, but 
observes that later' some were probably derived from Men. In saying   this 
(as the last paragraph and the reference to The Lord of the Rings Appendix F 
suggest) he seems   to have been thinking of Trolls, and specifically of the 
Olog-hai, the great Trolls who appeared at   the end of the Third Age (as 
stated in Appendix F): "That Sauron bred them none doubted, though   from 
what stock was not known. Some held that they were not Trolls but giant Orcs; 
but the Olog-hai   were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike even the 
largest of Orc-kind, whom they far   sur-passed in size and power.'   The 
conception that among the Orcs 'there must have been numerous corrupted minor 
spirits who   assumed similar bodily shapes' appears also in text VIII (p. 
410): 'Melkor had corrupted many   spirits - some great, as Sauron, or less 
so, as Balrogs. The least could have been primitive (and   much more powerful 
and perilous) Orcs' /Fr.168/.

<BR> MR (HME 10)/5:10. Myths Transformed. /Orcs-III/. /Autocomm./
<BR>X 
<BR> I give here a text of an altogether different kind, a very finished essay on the origin of the 
  Orcs'. It is necessary to explain something of the relations of this text. 
  There is a major work, which I hope to publish in The History of 
Middle-earth, entitled Essekenta   Eldarinwa or Quendi and Eldar, It is 
extant in a good typescript made by my father on his later   typewriter, both 
in top copy and carbon; and it is preceded in both copies by a manuscript page 
  which describes tie content of the work:   Enquiry into the origins of 
the Elvish names for Elves and their varieties clans and divisions:   with 
Appendices on their names for the other Incarnates: Men, Dwarves, and Orcs; and 
on their   analysis of their own language, Quenya: with a note on tile 
'Language of the Valar'.   With the appendices Quendi and Eldar runs to 
nearly fifty closely typed pages, and being a highly   finished and lucid 
work is of the utmost interest.   To one of the title pages my father 
subjoined the following:     To which is added an abbreviation of the 
Osanwe-kenta or 'Communication of Thought that Pengolodh   set at the end of 
his Lammas or 'Account of Tongues'   This is a separate work of eight 
typescript pages, separately paginated, but found together with   both copies 
of Quendi and Eldar. In addition, and not referred to on the title-pages, there 
is a   further typescript of four pages (also found with both copies of 
Quendi and Eldar) entitled Orcs,   and this is the text given here.   All 
three elements are identical in general appearance, but Orcs stands apart from 
the others,   having no linguistic bearing; and in view of this I have 
thought it legitimate to abstract it and   print it in this book together 
with the other discussions of the origin of the Orcs given as texts   VIII / 
Fr.168/ and IX / Fr.169/.   As to the date of this complex, one of the copies 
is preserved in a folded newspaper of March   1960. On this my father wrote: 
'"Quendi and Eldar" with Appendices'; beneath is a brief list of the 
  Appendices, the items all written at the same time, which includes both 
Osanwe and Origin of Orcs   (the same is true of the cover of the other copy 
of the Quendi and Eldar complex). All the material   was thus in being when 
the newspaper was used for this purpose, and although, as in other similar 
  cases, this does not provide a perfectly certain terminus ad quern, there 
seems no reason to doubt   that it belongs to 1959-60 (cf. p. 304). 
<BR> Appendix C to Quendi and Eldar, 'Elvish Names for the Orcs' / Fr.192/, is 
primarily concerned with   etymology, but it opens with the following 
passage:   It is not here the place to debate the question of the origin of 
the Orcs. They were bred by   Melkor, and their breeding was the most wicked 
and lamentable of his works in Arda, but not the   most terrible. For clearly 
they were meant in his malice to be a mockery of the Children of   Iluvatar, 
wholly subservient to his will, and nursed in an unappeasable hatred of Elves 
and Men.   The Orcs of the later wars, after the escape of Melkor-Morgoth and 
his return to Middle-earth,   were neither spirits nor phantoms, but living 
creatures, capable of speech and of some crafts and   organization, or at 
least capable of learning such things from higher creatures or from their 
  Master. They bred and multiplied rapidly whenever left undisturbed. It is 
unlikely, as a   consideration of the ultimate origin of this race would make 
clearer, that the Quendi had met any   Orcs of this kind, before their 
finding by Oromл and the separation of Eldar and Avari.   But it is known 
that Melkor had become aware of the Quendi before the Valar began their war 
  against him, and the joy of the Elves in Middle-earth had already been 
darkened by shadows of fear.   Dreadful shapes had begun to haunt the borders 
of their dwellings, and some of their people   vanished into the darkness and 
were heard of no more. Some of these things may have been phantoms   and 
delusions; but some were, no doubt, shapes taken by the servants of Melkor, 
mocking and   degrading the very forms of the Children. For Melkor had in his 
service great numbers of the Maiar,   who had the power, as had their Master, 
of taking visible and tangible shape in Arda.   No doubt my father was led 
from his words here 'It is unlikely, as a consideration of the ultimate 
  origin of this race would make clearer, that the Quendi had met any Orcs of 
this kind, before their   finding by Oromл' to write that 'consideration' 
which follows here. It will be seen that one   passage of this initial 
statement was re-used. <BR> Orcs /OrcsIIIA/ <BR> The origin of the Orcs is a 
matter of debate. Some have called them the Melkorohнni, the Children   of 
Melkor; but the wiser say: nay, the slaves of Melkor, but not his children; for 
Melkor had no   children. (1) Nonetheless, it was by the malice of Melkor 
that the Orcs arose, and plainly they   were meant by him to be a mockery of 
the Children of Eru, being bred to be wholly subservient to   his will and 
filled with unappeasable hatred of Elves and Men.   Now the Orcs of the later 
wars, after the escape of Melkor-Morgoth and his return to Middle-earth, 
  were not 'spirits', nor phantoms, but living creatures, capable of speech 
and some crafts and   organization; or at least capable of learning these 
things from higher creatures and from their   Master. They bred and 
multiplied rapidly, whenever left undisturbed. So far as can be gleaned from 
  the legends that have come down to us from our earliest days, (2) it would 
seem that the Quendi had   never yet encountered any Orcs of this kind before 
the coming of Oromл to Cuiviйnen.   Those who believe that the Orcs were bred 
from some kind of Men, captured and perverted by Melkor,   assert that it was 
impossible for the Quendi to have known of Orcs before the Separation and the 
  departure of the Eldar. For though the time of the awakening of Men is not 
known, even the   calculations of the loremasters that place it earliest do 
not assign it a date long before the   Great March began, (3) certainly not 
long enough before it to allow for the corruption of Men into   Orcs. On the 
other hand, it is plain that soon after his return Morgoth had at his command a 
great   number of these creatures, with whom he ere long began to attack the 
Elves. There was still less   time between his return and these first 
assaults for the breeding of Orcs and for the transfer of   their hosts 
westward.   This view of the origin of the Orcs thus meets with difficulties 
of chronology. But though Men may   take comfort in this, the theory remains 
nonetheless the most probable. It accords with all that is   known of Melkor, 
and of the nature and behaviour of Orcs - and of Men. Melkor was impotent to 
  produce any living thing, but skilled in the corruption of things that did 
not proceed from   himself, if he could dominate them. But if he had indeed 
attempted to make creatures of his own in   imitation or mockery of the 
Incarnates, he would, like Aule, only have succeeded in producing   puppets: 
his creatures would have acted only while the attention of his will was upon 
them, and   they would have shown no reluctance to execute any command of 
his, even if it were to destroy   themselves.   But the Orcs were not of 
this kind. They were certainly dominated by their Master, but his   dominion 
was by fear, and they were aware of this fear and hated him. They were indeed so 
corrupted   that they were pitiless, and there was no cruelty or wickedness 
that they would not commit; but   this was the corruption of independent 
wills, and they took pleasure in their deeds. They were   capable of acting 
on their own, doing evil deeds unbidden for their own sport; or if Morgoth and 
  his agents were far away, they might neglect his commands. They sometimes 
fought [&gt; They hated one another and often fought] among themselves, to the 
detriment of Morgoth's plans.   Moreover, the Orcs continued to live and 
breed and to carry on their business of ravaging and   plundering after 
Morgoth was overthrown. They had other characteristics of the Incarnates also. 
  They had languages of their own, and spoke among themselves in various 
tongues according to   differences of breed that were discernible among them. 
They needed food and drink, and rest, though   many were by training as tough 
as Dwarves in enduring hardship. They could be slain, and they were   subject 
to disease; but apart from these ills they died and were not immortal, even 
according to   the manner of the Quendi; indeed they appear to have been by 
nature short-lived compared with the   span of Men of higher race, such as 
the Edain.   This last point was not well understood in the Elder Days. For 
Morgoth had many servants, the   oldest and most potent of whom were 
immortal, belonging indeed in their beginning to the Maiar; and   these evil 
spirits like their Master could take on visible forms. Those whose business it 
was to   direct the Orcs often took Orkish shapes, though they were greater 
and more terrible. (4) Thus it   was that the histories speak of Great Orcs 
or Orc-captains who were not slain, and who reappeared   in battle through 
years far longer than the span of the lives of Men.* 
<BR>[*footnote to the text: Boldog, for instance, is a name that occurs many times in the tales of the War. But it is possible   that Boldog was not a personal name, and either a title, or else the name of a kind of creature:   the Orc-formed Maiar, only less formidable than the Balrogs]. (5)   Finally, there is a cogent point, though horrible to relate. It became clear in time that undoubted Men could under the domination of Morgoth or his agents in a few generations be reduced  almost to the Orc-level of mind and habits; and then they would or could be made to mate with Orcs, producing new breeds, often larger and more 
cunning. There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the Third Age, Saruman 
rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery 
 committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, 
producing both Men-orcs   large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and 
vile. But even before this wickedness of Morgoth was suspected the Wise in 
the Elder Days taught always that the Orcs were not 'made' by Melkor, and 
therefore were not in their origin evil. They might have become 
irredeemable (at least by Elves and Men), but they remained within the Law. That 
is,   that though of necessity, being the fingers of the hand of Morgoth, 
they must be fought with the   utmost severity, they must not be dealt with 
in their own terms of cruelty and treachery. Captives   must not be 
tormented, not even to discover information for the defence of the homes of 
Elves and   Men. If any Orcs surrendered and asked for mercy, they must be 
granted it, even at a cost.** 
<BR>[**footnote to the text: Few Orcs ever did so 
in the Elder Days, and at no time would any Orc treat   with any Elf. For one 
thing Morgoth had achieved was to convince the Orcs beyond refutation that 
  the Elves were crueller than themselves, taking captives only for 
'amusement', or to eat them (as   the Orcs would do at need)]. This was the 
teaching of the Wise, though in the horror of the War it   was not always 
heeded.   It is true, of course, that Morgoth held the Orcs in dire thraldom; 
for in their corruption they   had lost almost all possibility of resisting 
the domination of his will. So great indeed did its   pressure upon them 
become ere Angband fell that, if he turned his thought towards them, they were 
  conscious of his 'eye' wherever they might be; and when Morgoth was at last 
removed from Arda the   Orcs that survived in the West were scattered, 
leaderless and almost witless, and were for a long   time without control or 
purpose.   This servitude to a central will that reduced the Orcs almost to 
an ant-like life was seen even   more plainly in the Second and Third Ages 
under the tyranny of Sauron, Morgoth's chief lieutenant.   Sauron indeed 
achieved even greater control over his Orcs than Morgoth had done. He was, of 
course,   operating on a smaller scale, and he had no enemies so great and so 
fell as were the Noldor in   their might in the Elder Days. But he had also 
inherited from those days difficulties, such as the   diversity of the Orcs 
in breed and language, and the feuds among them; while in many places in 
  Middle-earth, after the fall of Thangorodrim and during the concealment of 
Sauron, the Orcs   recovering from their helplessness had set up petty realms 
of their own and had become accustomed   to independence. Nonetheless Sauron 
in time managed to unite them all in unreasoning hatred of the   Elves and of 
Men who associated with them; while the Orcs of his own trained armies were so 
  completely under his will that they would sacrifice themselves without 
hesitation at his   com-mand.*** [***footnote to the text: But there remained 
one flaw in his control, inevitable. In   the kingdom of hate and fear, the 
strongest thing is hate. All his Orcs hated one another, and must   be kept 
ever at war with some 'enemy' to prevent them from slaying one another]. And he 
proved even   more skilful than his Master also in the corruption of Men who 
were beyond the reach of the Wise,   and in reducing them to a vassalage, in 
which they would march with the Orcs, and vie with them in   cruelty and 
destruction.   If is thus probably to Sauron that we may look for a solution 
of the problem of chronology. Though   of immensely smaller native power than 
his Master, he remained less corrupt, cooler and more   capable of 
calculation. At least in the Elder Days, and before he was bereft of his lord 
and fell   into the folly of imitating him, and endeavouring to become 
himself supreme Lord of Middle-earth.   While Morgoth still stood, Sauron did 
not seek his own supremacy, but worked and schemed for   another, desiring 
the triumph of Melkor, whom in the begin-ning he had adored. He thus was often 
  able to achieve things, first conceived by Melkor, which his master did not 
or could not complete   in the furious haste of his malice.   We may 
assume, then, that the idea of breeding the Orcs came from Melkor, not at first 
maybe so   much for the provision of servants or the infantry of his wars of 
destruction, as for the   defilement of the Children and the blasphemous 
mockery of the designs of Eru. The details of the   accomplishment of this 
wickedness were, however, left mainly to the subtleties of Sauron. In that 
  case the conception in mind of the Orcs may go far back into the night of 
Melkor's thought, though   the beginning of their actual breeding must await 
the awakening of Men.   When Melkor was made captive, Sauron escaped and lay 
hid, in Middle-earth; and it can in this way   be understood how the breeding 
of the Orcs (no doubt already begun) went on with increasing speed   during 
the age when the Noldor dwelt in Aman; so that when they returned to 
Middle-earth they found   it already infested with this plague, to the 
torment of all that dwelt there, Elves or Men or   Dwarves. It was Sauron, 
also, who secretly repaired Angband for the help of his Master when he 
  returned; (6) and there the dark places underground were already manned 
with hosts of the Orcs   before Melkor came back at last, as Morgoth the 
Black Enemy, and sent them forth to bring ruin upon   all that was fair. And 
though Angband has fallen and Morgoth is removed, still they come forth from 
  the lightless places in the darkness of their hearts, and the earth is 
withered under their   pitiless feet.   This then, as it may appear, was 
my father's final view of the question: Orcs were bred from Men,   and if 
'the conception in mind of the Orcs may go far back into the night of Melkor's 
thought' it   was Sauron who, during the ages of Melkor's captivity in Aman, 
brought into being the black armies   that were available to his Master when 
he returned.   But, as always, it is not quite so simple. Accompanying one 
copy of the typescript of this essay   are some pages in manuscript for which 
my father used the blank reverse sides of papers provided by   the publishers 
dated 10 November 1969. These pages carry two notes on the 'Orcs' essay: one, 
  discussing the spelling of the word orc, is given on p. 422 / Fr.170, 
OrcsIIIB/; the other is a   note arising from something in the essay which is 
not indicated, but which is obviously the passage   on p. 417 / Fr.170, 
ORcsIIIA/ discussing the puppet-like nature inevitable in creatures brought 
  into being by one of the great Powers themselves: the note was intended to 
stand in relation to the   words 'But the Orcs were not of this kind'. 
  The orks, it is true, sometimes appear to have been reduced to a condition 
very similar, though   there remains actually a profound difference. Those 
orks who dwell long under the immediate   attention of his will - as 
garrisons of his strongholds or elements of armies trained for special 
  purposes in his war-designs - would act like herds, obeying instantly, as 
if with one will, his   commands even if ordered to sacrifice their lives in 
his service. And as was seen when Morgoth was   at last overthrown and cast 
out, those orks that had been so absorbed scattered helplessly, without 
  purpose either to flee or to fight, and soon died or slew themselves. 
  Other originally independent creatures, and Men among them (but neither 
Elves nor Dwarves), could   also be reduced to a like condition. But 
'puppets', with no independent life or will, would simply   cease to move or 
do anything at all when the will of their maker was brought to nothing. In any 
  case the number of orks that were thus 'absorbed' was always only a small 
part of their total. To   hold them in absolute servitude required a great 
expense of will. Morgoth though in origin   possessed of vast power was 
finite; and it was this expenditure upon the orks, and still more upon   the 
other far more formidable creatures in his service, that in the event so 
dissipated his powers   of mind that Morgoth's overthrow became possible. 
Thus the greater part of the orks, though under   his orders and the dark 
shadow of their fear of him, were only intermittently objects of his 
  immediate thought and concern, and while that was re-moved they relapsed 
into independence and   became conscious of their hatred of him and his 
tyranny. Then they might neglect his orders, or   engage in /their own 
achievements.../...   Here the text breaks off. But the curious thing is that 
rough drafting for the second paragraph of   this note (written on the same 
paper bearing the same date) begins thus:   But Men could (and can still) be 
reduced to such a condition. 'Puppets' would simply cease to move   or 'live' 
at all, when not set in motion by the direct will of their maker. In any case, 
though the   number of orks at the height of Morgoth's power, and still after 
his return from captivity, seems   to have been very great, those who were 
'absorbed' were always a small part of the total.   The words that I have 
italicised deny an essential conception of the essay.     The other note 
reads thus:   Orcs /Orcs IIIB/   This spelling was taken from Old English. 
The word seemed, in itself, very suitable to the   creatures that I had in 
mind. But the Old English orc in meaning - so far as that is known - is not 
  suitable. (7) Also the spelling of what, in the later more organized 
linguistic situation, must   have been a Common Speech form of a word or 
group of similar words should be ork. If only because   of spelling 
difficulties in modern English: an adjective orc + ish becomes necessary, and 
orcish   will not do. (8) In any future publication I 
shall use ork.   In text IX / Fr.169/ (the brief writing in which my father 
declared the theory of Elvish origin to   be certain) he spelt the word Orks, 
and said 'so I shall spell it in The Silmarillion'. In the   present essay, 
obviously later than text IX, it is spelt Orcs, but now, in 1969 or later, he 
asserted again that it must be orks.     
<BR>Note 1. See text VII, p. 
406 / Fr.167, iii, end/. - On one copy of the text my father pencilled 
against this sentence the names Eruseni, Melkorseni. 
<BR>Note 2. Legends 
that have come down to us from our earliest days': this purports then to be an 
  Elvish writing. Sauron is spoken of subsequently as a being of the past 
(This servitude to a   central will .. . was seen even more plainly in the 
Second and Third Ages under the tyranny of   Sauron', p. 419); but in the 
last sentence of the essay the Orcs are a plague that still afflicts   the 
world. 
<BR>Note 3. The time of the Awakening of Men is now placed far back; cf. 
text II (p. 378): 'The March of the Eldar is through great Rains? Men awake in an isle amid the floods'; 'The coming of Men will therefore be much further back'; 'Men must awake while Melkor is still 
in - because of their Fall. Therefore in some period during the Great 
March (see p. 385 note 14). In the chronology of the Annals of Aman and the 
Grey Annals the Great March began in the Year of the Trees 1105 (p. 82), and 
the foremost companies of the Eldar came to the shores of the Great Sea in 
1125; Men awoke in   Hildorien in the year of the first rising of the Sun, 
which was the Year of the Trees 1500. Thus if   the Awakening of Men is 
placed even very late in the period of the Great March of the Eldar it will 
be set back by more than 3500 Years of the Sun. See further p. 430 note 5. 
<BR> Note 4. Cf. text IX, p. 414: 'But always among them  (as special servants 
and spies of Melkor, and   as leaders) there must have been numerous 
corrupted minor spirits who assumed similar bodily   shapes' / Fr.169/; also 
text VIII, p. 410 /Fr.168/. 
<BR>Note 5. The footnote at this point, staring 
that 'Boldog, for instance, is a name that occurs many   times in the tales 
of the War', and was perhaps not a personal name, is curious. Boldog appears 
several times in the Lay of Leithian as the name of the Orc-captain who led 
a raid into Doriath   (references in the Index to The Lays of Beleriand); he 
reappears in the Quenta (IV.113), but is not   mentioned thereafter. I do not 
know of any other reference to an Orc named Boldog, Note 7. On the later 
story that Angband was built by Melkor in the ancient days and that it was 
commanded by Sauron see p. 156, §12. There has been no reference to the 
repairing of Angband against Morgoth's return, and cf. the last narrative 
development in the Quenta Silmarillion of the   story of his return (p. 295, 
§14): Morgoth and Ungoliant 'were drawing near to the ruins of Angband 
where his great western stronghold had been.' <BR> Note 7. See p. 124 / 
Fr.162b/. <BR> Note 8. 'orcish will not do': because it would be pronounced 
'orsish'. The Orkish language was so   spelt in The Lord of the Rings from 
the First Edition.

among the rough draft pages referred to on p. 4 there is   in fact a 
substantial passage beginning: 'In this same time the Quendi awoke by the waters 
of   Kuivienen: of which more is said in the Chronicles of Aman.' The text 
that follows in this draft is   very close - much of it indeed virtually 
identical - to the long passage interpolated into AAm   (§§43-5 / Fr.161/) on 
the fear of Orome among the Quendi, the ensnaring of them by the servants of 
Melkor, and the breeding of the Orcs from those captured. There are no 
differences of substance   between this text and the passage in AAm; and it 
is obvious that the latter followed, and was based   on, the former, 
originally intended for inclusion in the Grey Annals.  
<BR>In AAm the same dates are given for the Awakening of the Elves (1050) and for their discovery by

according to   which the Orcs existed before ever Orome came upon the Elves, 
being indeed bred by Morgoth from   captured Elves; the older tradition, that 
Morgoth brought the Orcs into being when he returned to Middle-earth from 
Valinor, survived unchanged in the final form of the Quenta Silmarillion (see 
  X.194, §62). See further under /Comm. to/ §29 below.

<BR>Indeed we learn now in Eressea 
from the Valar, through our /Elvish/ kin that dwell still in   Aman, that 
after Dagor-nuin-Giliath Melkor was so long in assailing the Eldar with strength 
for he   himself had departed from Angband, for the last time. Even as before 
at the awakening of the   Quendi, his spies were watchful, and tidings soon 
came to him of the arising of Men. This seemed to   him so great a matter 
that secretly under shadow he went forth into Middle-earth, leaving the 
  command of the War to Sauron his lieutenant. Of his dealings with Men the 
Eldar knew naught at that   time, and know little now, for neither the Valar 
nor Men have spoken to them clearly of these   things. . But that some 
darkness lay upon the hearts of Men (as the shadow of the kinslaying and 
  the doom of Mandos lay upon the Noldor) the Eldar perceived clearly even in 
the fair folk of the   Elf-friends that they first knew. To corrupt or 
destroy whatsoever arose new and fair was ever the   chief desire of Morgoth; 
but as regards the Eldar, doubtless he had this purpose also in his   errand: 
by fear and lies to make Men their foes, and bring them up out of the East 
against   Beleriand. But this design was slow to ripen, and was never wholly 
achieved, for Men (it is said)   were at first very few in number, whereas 
Morgoth grew afraid of the tidings of the growing power   and union of the 
Eldar and came back to Angband, leaving behind at that time but few servants, 
and   those of less might and cunning. 
<BR>From them /Dark Elves of the 
Eastlands = Avari/ it is said that they took the first beginnings of   the 
western tongues of Men; and from them also they heard rumour of the Blessed 
Realms of the West   and of the Powers of Light that dwelt there. Therefore 
many of the Fathers of Men, the Atanatari, in their wanderings moved ever 
westward, fleeing from the darkness that had ensnared them. For   these 
Elf-friends were Men that had repented and rebelled against the Dark Power, and 
were cruelly   hunted and oppressed by those that worshipped it, and its 
servants. 
<BR>/Comm. to §87/. The very interesting addition at the end of the 
annal belongs with the insertion about Morgoth's departure into the East. 
There it is said (§80): 'But that some darkness lay upon the hearts of Men 
... the Eldar perceived clearly even in the fair folk of the Elf-friends that 
they first knew'; but the present passage is the first definite statement 
that Men in their beginning fell to the worship of Morgoth, and that the 
Elf-friends, repentant, fled west to escape   persecution. In the long 
account of his works written for Milton Waldman in 1951, and so very 
probably belonging to the same period, my father had said: 'The first fall 
of Man ... nowhere appears - Men do not come on the stage until all that is 
long past, and there is only a rumour that   for a while they fell under the 
domination of the Enemy and that some repented' (Letters no.131, pp. 147-8; 
see X.354 - 5).

<BR>/After the Third Battle, Dagor Aglareb (60 Year of Sun)/. Certain it is that at this time (which was the time of his return, if the aforesaid account be true, as we must believe) 
Morgoth began a new evil, desiring above all to sow fear and disunion among 
the Eldar in Beleriand. He now bade the Orkor to take alive any of the 
Eldar that they could and bring them bound to Angband. For it was his 
intent to use their lore and skill under duress for his own ends; moreover he 
took pleasure in tormenting them, and would besides by pain wring from them 
at times tidings of the deeds and counsels of his enemies. Some indeed he 
so daunted by the terror of his eyes that they needed no chains more, but 
walked ever in fear of him, doing his will wherever they might be. These he 
would unbind and let return to work treason among their own kin. In this 
way also was the curse of Mandos fulfilled, for after a while the Elves 
grew afraid of those who claimed to have escaped from thraldom, and often 
those hapless whom the Orcs ensnared, even if they broke from the toils would 
but wander homeless and friendless thereafter, becoming outlaws in the 
woods.

        <BR>B. Meanings and use of the various terms applied to 
          the Elves and their varieties in Quenya, Telerin, and Sindarin. <BR> Quenya.   
<BR>1. quen, pl. queni, person, individual, man or woman. Chiefly used in 
          the unstressed form quen. Mostly found in the singular: 'one, somebody'; 
          in the pl. 'people, they'. Also combined with other  elements, as in 
          aiquen 'if anybody, whoever', ilquen 'everybody'. In a number of old 
          compounds  -quen, pl. queni was combined with noun or adjective stems 
          to denote habitual occupations or  functions, or to describe those having 
          some notable (permanent) quality: as -man in English (but  without distinction 
          of sex) in horseman, seaman, work- man, nobleman, etc. Q roquen 'horseman, 
           rider'; (Note 3, p. 407) kiryaquen 'shipman, sailor'; arquen 'a noble'. 
          These words belong to  everyday speech, and have no special reference 
          to Elves. They were freely applied to other  Incarnates, such as Men 
          or Dwarves, when the Eldar became acquainted with them.   <BR>2. Quendi Elves, of any kind, including the Avari. The sg. Quende 
was naturally less frequently   used. As has been seen, the word was made 
when the Elves as yet knew of no other 'people' than   themselves. The sense 
'the Elvish people, as a whole', or in the sg. 'an Elf and not some other 
  similar creature', developed first in Aman, where the Elves lived among or 
in contact with the   Valar and Maiar. During the Exile when the Noldor 
became re-associated with their Elvish kin, the   Sindar, but met other 
non-Elvish people, such as Orcs, Dwarves, and Men, it became an even more 
  useful term. But in fact it had ceased in Aman to be a word of everyday 
use, and remained   thereafter mainly used in the special language of Lore: 
histories or tales of old days, or learned   writings on peoples and 
languages. In ordinary language the Elves of Aman called themselves Eldar 
  (or in Telerin Elloi): see below. There also existed two old compounds 
containing *kwendi:   *kala-kwendi and *mori-kwendi, the Light-folk and the 
Dark-folk. These terms appear to go back to   the period before the 
Separation, or rather to the time of the debate among the Quendi concerning 
  the invitation of the Valar. They were evidently made by the party 
favourable to Orome, and   referred originally to those who desired the Light 
of Valinor (where the ambassadors of the Elves   reported that there was no 
darkness), and those who did not wish for a place in which there was no 
  night. But already before the final separation *mori-kwendi may have 
referred to the glooms and the   clouds dimming the sun and the stars during 
the War of the Valar and Melkor,(6) so that the term   from the beginning had 
a tinge of scorn, implying that such folk were not averse to the shadows of 
  Melkor upon Middle-earth.     The lineal descendants of these terms 
survived only in the languages of Aman. The Quenya forms   were Kalaquendi 
and Moriquendi. The Kalaquendi in Quenya applied only to the Elves who actually 
  lived or had lived in Aman; and the Moriquendi was applied to all others, 
whether they had come on   the March or not. The latter were regarded as 
greatly inferior to the Kalaquendi, who had   experienced the Light of 
Valinor, and had also acquired far greater knowledge and powers by their 
  association with the Valar and Maiar. In the period of Exile the Noldor 
modified their use of these   terms, which was offensive to the Sindar. 
Kalaquendi went out of use, except in written Noldorin   lore. Moriquendi was 
now applied to all other Elves, except the Noldor and Sindar, that is to Avari 
  or to any kind of Elves that at the time of the coming of the Noldor had 
not long dwelt in   Beleriand and were not subjects of Elwe. It was never 
applied, however, to any but Elvish peoples.   The old distinction, when 
made, was represented by the new terms Amanyar 'those of Aman', and 
  Uamanyar or Umanyar 'those not of Aman', beside the longer forms Amaneldi 
and Umaneldi.
<BR> 3. Quendya, in the Noldorin dialect Quenya. This word 
remained in ordinary use, but it was only   used as a noun 'the Quendian 
language'. (Note 4, p. 407) This use of Quendya must have arisen in   Aman, 
while Quendi still remained in general use. Historically, and in the more 
accurate use of the   linguistic Loremasters, Quenya included the dialect of 
the Teleri, which though divergent (in some   points from days before 
settlement in Aman, such as *kw &gt; p), remained generally intelligible to 
  the Vanyar and Noldor. But in ordinary use it was applied only to the 
dialects of the Vanyar and   Noldor, the differences between which only 
appeared later, and remained, up to the period just   before the Exile, of 
minor importance. In the use of the Exiles Quenya naturally came to mean the 
  language of the Noldor, developed in Aman, as distinct from other tongues, 
whether Elvish or not.   But the Noldor did not forget its connexion with the 
old word Quendi, and still regarded the name   as implying 'Elvish', that is 
the chief Elvish tongue, the noblest, and the one most nearly   preserving 
the ancient character of Elvish speech. For a note on the Elvish words for 
'language',   especially among the Noldorin Loremasters, see Appendix D (p. 
391).   
<BR>4. Elda and Eldo. The original distinction between these forms as 
meaning 'one of the Star-folk,   or Elves in general', and one of the 
'Marchers', became obscured by the close approach of the   forms. The form 
Eldo went out of use, and Elda remained the chief word for 'Elf' in Quenya. But 
it   was not in accurate use held to include the Avari (when they were 
remembered or considered); i.e.   it took on the sense of Eldo. It may, 
however, have been partly due to its older sense that in   popular use it was 
the word ordinarily employed for any Elf, that is, as an equivalent of the 
  Quende of the Loremasters. When one of the Elves of Aman spoke of the 
Eldalie, 'the Elven-folk', he   meant vaguely all the race of Elves, though 
he was probably not thinking of the Avari.     For, of course, the special 
kinship of the Amanyar with those left in Beleriand (or Hekeldamar)   was 
remembered, especially by the Teleri. When it was necessary to distinguish these 
two branches   of the Eldar (or properly Eldor), those who had come to Aman 
were called the Odzeldi N Oareldi, for   which another form (less used) was 
Auzeldi, N Aureldi; those who had remained behind were the   Hekeldi. These 
terms naturally belonged rather to history than everyday speech, and in the 
period   of the Exile they fell out of use, being unsuitable to the situation 
in Beleriand. The Exiles still   claimed to be Amanyar, but in practice this 
term usually now meant those Elves remaining in Aman,   while the Exiles 
called themselves Etyangoldi 'Exiled Noldor', or simply (since the great 
majority   of their clan had come into exile) Noldor. All the subjects of 
Elwe they called Sindar or   'Grey-elves'.     
<BR> Telerin. 1. The 
derivatives of *KWEN were more sparingly represented in the Telerin dialects, of 
  Aman or Beleriand. This was in part due to the Common Telerin change of kw 
&gt; p, (Note 5, p. 407)   which caused *pen &lt; *kwen to clash with the PQ 
stem *PEN 'lack, be without', and also with some of   the derivatives of *PED 
'slope, slant down' (e.g. *penda 'sloping'). Also the Teleri felt 
  themselves to be a separate people, as compared with the Vanyar and Noldor, 
whom taken together   they outnumbered. This sentiment began before the 
Separation, and increased on the March and in   Beleriand. In consequence 
they did not feel strongly the need for a general word embracing all   Elves, 
until they came in contact with other non-Elvish Incarnates. As a pronoun 
enclitic (e.g. in   aipen, Q aiquen; ilpen, Q ilquen) *kwen survived in 
Telerin; but few of the compounds with <i>pen</i> 'man' remained in ordinary use, 
except <i>arpen</i> 'noble (man)', and the derived adjective arpenia. 
<BR> Pendi, the 
dialectal equivalent of Q Quendi, survived only as a learned word of the 
historians,   used with reference to ancient days before the Separation; the 
adjective *Pendia (the equivalent of Quendya) had fallen out of use.. (Note 
6, p. 408) 
The Teleri had little interest in linguistic   lore, which they left to the 
Noldor. They did not regard their language as a 'dialect' of Quenya,   but 
called it Lindarin or Lindalambe. Quenya they called Goldorin or Goldolambe; for 
they had few contacts with the Vanyar.   
<BR>The old compounds in Telerin 
form Calapendi and Moripendi survived in historical use; but since   the 
Teleri in Aman remained more conscious of their kinship with the Elves left in 
Beleriand, while   Calapendi was used, as Kalaquendi in Quenya, to refer only 
to the Elves of Aman, Moripendi was not   applied to the Elves of Telerin 
origin who had not reached Aman.   
<BR>2. Ello and Ella. The history of the 
meanings of these words was almost identical with that of the   corresponding 
Elda and Eldo in Quenya. In Telerin the -o form became preferred, so that 
generally T   Ello was the equivalent of Q Elda. But Ella remained in use in 
quasi-adjectival function (e.g. as   the first element in loose or genitival 
compounds): thus the equivalent of Q Eldalie was in T   Ellalie.     In 
contrast to the Elloi left in Beleriand those in Aman were in histories called 
Audel, pl.   Audelli. Those in Beleriand were the Hecelloi of Heculbar (or 
Hecellubar).   
<BR>Sindarin. 1. Derivatives of *KWEN were limited to the sense: 
pronominal 'one, somebody, anybody',   and to a few old compounds that 
survived. PQ *kwende, *kwendi disappeared altogether. The reasons   for this 
were partly the linguistic changes already cited; and partly the circumstances 
in which   the Sindar lived, until the return of the Noldor, and the coming 
of Men. The linguistic changes   made the words unsuitable for survival; the 
circumstances removed all practical need for the term.   The old unity of the 
Elves had been broken at the Separation. The Elves of Beleriand were isolated, 
  without contact with any other people, Elvish or of other kind; and they 
were all of one clan and   language: Telerin (or Lindarin). Their own 
language was the only one that they ever heard; and they   needed no word to 
distinguish it, nor to distinguish themselves.   <BR>As a pronoun, usually 
enclitic, the form <i>pen</i>, mutated <i>ben</i>, survived. A few compounds survived, 
  such as <i>rochben</i> 'rider' (m. or f.), orodben 'a mountaineer' or 'one living 
in the mountains', <i>arphen</i> 'a noble'. Their plurals were made by 
i-affection, originally carried through the word: as <i> roechbin</i>, <i>oerydbin</i>, 
<i>erphin</i>, but the normal form of the first element was often restored when the 
nature of the composition remained evident: as <i>rochbin</i>, but always <i>erphin</i>. 
These words had no   special association with Elves.   <BR> Associated with 
these compounds were the two old words Calben (Celbin) and Morben (Moerbin). On 
  the formal relation of these to Quenya Kalaquendi and Moriquendi see p. 
362. They had no reference   to Elves, except by accident of circumstance. 
Celbin retained what was, as has been said, probably   its original meaning: 
all Elves other than the Avari; and it included the Sindar. It was in fact 
  the equivalent (when one was needed) of the Quenya Eldar, Telerin Elloi. 
But it referred to Elves   only because no other people qualified for the 
title. Moerbin was similarly an equivalent for   Avari; but that it did not 
mean only 'Dark-elves' is seen by its ready application to other 
  Incarnates, when they later became known. By the Sindar anyone dwelling 
outside Beleriand, or   entering their realm from outside, was called a 
Morben. The first people of this kind to be met   were the Nandor, who 
entered East Beleriand over the passes of the Mountains before the return of 
  Morgoth; soon after his return came the first invasions of his Orcs from 
the North.(7) Somewhat   later the Sindar became aware of Avari, who had 
crept in small and secret groups into Beleriand   from the South. Later came 
the Men of the Three Houses, who were friendly; and later still Men of 
  other kinds. All these were at first acquaintance called Moerbin. (Note 7, 
p. 408) But 
when the   Nandor were recog nized as kinsfolk of Lindarin origin and speech 
(as was still recognizable), they   were received into the class of Celbin. 
The Men of the Three Houses were also soon removed from the   class of 
Moerbin. (Note 8, p. 408) hey were given their own name, 
Edain, and were seldom actually   called Celbin, but they were recognized as 
belonging to this class, which became . practically   equivalent to 'peoples 
in alliance in the War against Morgoth'. The Avari thus remained the chief 
  examples of Moerbin. Any individual Avar who joined with or was admitted 
among the Sindar (it   rarely happened) became a Calben; but the Avari in 
general remained secretive, hostile to the   Eldar, and untrustworthy; and 
they dwelt in hidden places in the deeper woods, or in caves. (Note   9, p. 
408) Moerbin 
as applied to them is usually translated 'Dark-elves', partly because Moriquendi 
  in the Quenya of the Exiled Noldor usually referred to them. But that no 
special reference to Elves   was intended by the Sindarin word is shown by 
the fact that Moerbin was at once applied to the new   bands of Men 
(Easterlings) that appeared before the Battle of the Nirnaeth. (Note 9, p. 
408) If in Sindarin an Avar, as distinct from other kinds of Morben, was intended, he 
was called Mornedhel.
<BR>2. Edhel, pl. Edhil. In spite of its ultimate 
derivation (see p. 360) this was the general word   for 'Elf, Elves'. In the 
earlier days it naturally referred only to the Eldarin Sindar, for no   other 
kind was ever seen; but later it was freely applied to Elves of any kind that 
entered   Beleriand. It was however only used in these two forms.     The 
masculine and feminine forms were Ellon m. and Elleth f. and the class-plural 
was Eldrim,   later Elrim, when this was not replaced by the more commonly 
used Eledhrim (see below). The form   without the m. and f. suffixes was not 
in use, and survived only in some old compounds, especially   personal names, 
in the form el, pl. il, as a final element. The form Elen, pl. Elin was only 
used   in histories or the works of the Loremasters, as a word to include all 
Elves (Eldar and Avari). But   the class-plural Eledhrim was the usual word 
for 'all the Elvish race', whenever such an expression   was needed.   
  All these words and forms, whatever their etymologies (see above), were 
applicable to any kind of   Elf. In fact Edhel was properly applied only to 
Eldar; Ell- may have a mixed origin; and Elen was   an ancient general word. 
(Note 10, p. 410)
<BR>3. The Sindar had no general name for themselves as 
distinct from other varieties of Elf, until   other kinds entered Beleriand. 
The descendant of the old clan name *Lindai (Q Lindar) had fallen   out of 
normal use, being no longer needed in a situation were all the Edhil were of the 
same kind,   and people were more aware of the growing differences in speech 
and other matters between those   sections of the Elves that lived in widely 
sundered parts of a large and mostly pathless land. They   were thus in 
ordinary speech all Edhil, but some belonged to one region and some to another: 
they were Falathrim from the sea-board of West Beleriand, or lathrim from 
Doriath (the land of the Fence, or <i>iath</i>), or Mithrim who had gone north 
from Beleriand and inhabited the regions about the   great lake that 
afterwards bore their name. (Note 11, p. 410)   <BR> The old clan-name *Lindai 
survived in the compound Glinnel, pl. Glinnil, a word only known in 
  historical lore, and the equivalent of Quenya Teleri or Lindar; see the 
Notes on the Clan-names   below. All the Sindarin subjects of King 
Elu-Thingol, as distinguished from the incoming Noldor,   were sometimes 
later called the Eluwaith. Dunedhil 'West-elves' (the reference being to the 
West of   Middle-earth) was a term made to match Dunedain 'West-men' (applied 
only to the Men of the Three   Houses). But with the growing amalgamation, 
outside Doriath, of the Noldor and Sindar into one   people using the 
Sindarin tongue as their daily speech, this soon became applied to both Noldor 
and   Sindar. While the Noldor were still distinct, and whenever it was 
desired to recall their   difference of origin, they were usually called 
Odhil (sg. Odhel). This as has been seen was   originally a name for all the 
Elves that left Beleriand for Aman. These were also called by the   Sindar 
Gwanwen, pl. Gwenwin (or Gwanwel, Gwenwil) 'the departed': cf. Q vanwa. This 
term, which   could not suitably be applied to those who had come back, 
remained the usual Sindarin name for the   Elves that remained in Aman. Odhil 
thus became specially the name of the Exiled Noldor. In this   sense the form 
Godhel, pl. Godhil soon replaced the older form. It seems to have been due to 
the   influence of the clan-name Golodh, pl. Goelydh; or rather to a 
deliberate blending of the two   words. The old clan-name had not fallen out 
of memory (for the Noldor and the Sindar owing to the   great friendship of 
Finwe and Elwe were closely associated during their sojourn in Beleriand before 
  the Departure) and it had in consequence a genuine Sindarin form (&lt; CE 
*ngolodo). But the form   Golodh seems to have been phonetically unpleas- ing 
to the Noldor. The name was, moreover, chiefly   used by those who wished to 
mark the difference between the Noldor and the Sindar, and to ignore   the 
dwelling of the Noldor in Aman which might give them a claim to superiority. 
This was   especially the case in Doriath, where King Thingol was hostile to 
the Noldorin chieftains, Feanor   and his sons, and Fingolfin, because of 
their assault upon the Teleri in Aman, the people of his   brother Olwe. The 
Noldor, therefore, when using Sindarin, never applied this name (Golodh) to 
  themselves, and it fell out of use among those friendly to them.
 <BR>4. 
Eglan, pl. Eglain, Egladrim. This name, 'the Forsaken', was, as has been said, 
given by the   Sindar to themselves. But it was not in Beleriand a name for 
all the Elves who remained there, as   were the related names, Hekeldi, 
Hecelloi, in Aman. It applied only to those who wished to depart,   and 
waited long in vain for the return of Ulmo, taking up their abode on or near the 
coasts. There   they became skilled in the building and management of ships. 
Cirdan was their lord.     Cirdan's folk were made up both of numbers of the 
following of Olwe, who straying or lingering   came to the shores too late, 
and also of many of the following of Elwe, who abandoned the search   for him 
and did not wish to be separated for ever from their kin and friends. This folk 
remained in   the desire of Aman for long years, and they were among the most 
friendly to the Exiles.   They continued to call themselves the Eglain, and 
the regions where they dwelt Eglamar and   Eglador. The latter name fell out 
of general use. It had originally been applied to all western   Beleriand 
between Mount Taras and the Bay of Balar, its eastern boundary being roughly 
along the   River Narog. Eglamar, however, remained the name of the 'Home of 
the Eglain': the sea-board from   Cape Andras to the headland of Bar-in-Myl 
('Home of the Gulls'),(8) which included the ship-havens 
  of Cirdan at Brithonbar (9) and at the head of the firth of Eglarest.   
  The Eglain became a people somewhat apart from the inland Elves, and at the 
time of the coming of   the Exiles their language was in many ways different. 
(Note 12, p. 411) But they acknowledged the   high-kingship of Thingol, and 
Cirdan never took the title of king.(10)   <BR> *Abari.   <BR> This name, 
evidently made by the Eldar at the time of the Separation, is found in histories 
in the   Quenya form Avari, and the Telerin form Abari. It was still used by 
the historians of the Exiled   Noldor, though it hardly differed from 
Moriquendi, which (see above) was no longer used by the   Exiles to include 
Elves of Eldarin origin. The plural Evair was known to Sindarin loremasters, but 
  was no longer in use. Such Avari as came into Beleriand were, as has been 
said, called Morben, or   Mornedhel.   <BR> Author's Note 7.   <BR> The 
Dwarves were in a special position. They claimed to have known Beleriand before 
even the Eldar   first came there; and there do appear to have been small 
groups dwelling furtively in the highlands   west of Sirion from a very early 
date: they attacked and waylaid the Elves by stealth, and the   Elves did not 
at first recognize them as Incarnates, but thought them to be some kind of 
cunning   animal, and hunted them. By their own account they were fugitives, 
driven into the wilderness by   their own kin further east, and later they 
were called the Noegyth Nibin (32) or Petty-dwarves, for   they had become 
smaller than the norm of their kind, and filled with hate for all other 
creatures.   When the Elves met the powerful Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost, 
in the eastern side of the   Mountains, they recognized them as Incarnates, 
for they had skill in many crafts, and learned the   Elvish speech readily 
for purposes of traffic. At first the Elves were in doubt concerning them, 
  believing them to be related to Orcs and creatures of Morgoth; but when 
they found that, though   proud and unfriendly, they could be trusted to keep 
any treaties that they made, and did not molest   those who left them in 
peace, they traded with them and let them come and go as they would. /.../.

names for Men. 
<BR> The first Elves that Men met in the world were Avari, some 
of whom were friendly to them, but the   most avoided them or were hostile 
(according to the tales of Men). What names Men and Elves gave to   one 
another in those remote days, of which little was remembered when the 
Loremasters in Beleriand   made the acquaintance of the After-born, there is 
now no record. By the Dunedain the Elves were   called Nimir (the 
Beautiful).(18) The Eldar did not meet Men of 
any kind or race until the Noldor   had long returned to Beleriand and were 
at war with Morgoth. The Sindar did not even know of their   existence, until 
the coming of the Nandor; and these brought only rumour of a strange people 
(whom   they had not themselves seen) wandering in the lands of the East 
beyond the Hithaeglir. From these   uncertain tales the Sindar concluded that 
the 'strange people' were either some diminished race of   the Avari, or else 
related to Orcs, creatures of Melkor, bred in mockery of the true Quendi. But 
  the Noldor had already heard of Men in Aman. Their knowledge came in the 
first place from Melkor   and was perverted by his malice, but before the 
Exile those who would listen had learned more of   the truth from the Valar, 
and they knew that the newcomers were akin to themselves, being also 
  Children of Iluvatar, though differing in gifts and fate. Therefore the 
Noldor made names for the   Second Race of the Children, calling them the 
Atani 'the Second Folk'. /.../. 

        <P align="justify"><B>Fr.191.</B> <BR> WJ (HME11)/3:4. Quendi and Eldar. Appendix B. Elvish names for the Dvarwes.   
<BR>The Sindar 
had long known the Dwarves, and had entered into peaceful relations with them, 
though   of trade and exchange of skills rather than of true friendship, 
before the coming of the Exiles.   The name (in the plural) that the Dwarves 
gave to themselves was Khazad, and this the Sindar   rendered as they might 
in the terms of their own speech, giving it the form *chadod &gt; *chadaud &gt; 
  Hadhod. (Note 22, p. 412) Hadhod, Hadhodrim was the name which they 
continued to use in actual   intercourse with the Dwarves; but among 
themselves they referred to the Dwarves usually as the   Naugrim 'the Stunted 
Folk'. The adjective naug 'dwarf(ed), stunted', however, was not used by 
  itself for one of the Khazad. The word used was Nogoth, pl. Noegyth, 
class-plural Nogothrim (as an   occasional equivalent of Naugrim). (Note 23, 
p. 413) They also often referred to the Dwarves as a   race by the name 
Dornhoth 'the Thrawn Folk', because of their stubborn mood as well as bodily 
  toughness.   <BR> The Exiles heard of the Dwarves first from the Sindar, 
and when using the Sindarin tongue   naturally adopted the already 
established names. But later in Eastern Beleriand the Noldor came   into 
independent relations with the Dwarves of Eryd Lindon, and they adapted the name 
Khazad anew   for use in Quenya, giving it the form Kasar, pl. Kasari or 
Kasari. (Note 24, p. 413) This was the   word most commonly used in Quenya 
for the Dwarves, the partitive plural being Kasalli, and the   race-name 
Kasallie. But the Sindarin names were also adapted or imitated, a Dwarf being 
called   Nauko or Norno (the whole people Naukalie or Nornalie). Norno was 
the more friendly term. (Note 25,   p. 413)     The Petty-dwarves. See 
also Note 7 / Fr.89, the end/. The Eldar did not at first recognize these 
  as Incarnates, for they seldom caught sight of them in clear light. They 
only became aware of their   existence indeed when they attacked the Eldar by 
stealth at night, or if they caught them alone in   wild places. The Eldar 
therefore thought that they were a kind of cunning two-legged animals living 
  in caves, and they called them Levain tad-dail, or simply Tad-dail, and 
they hunted them. But after   the Eldar had made the acquaintance of the 
Naugrim, the Tad-dail were recognized as a variety of   Dwarves and were left 
alone. There were then few of them surviving, and they were very wary, and 
  too fearful to attack any Elf, unless their hiding-places were approached 
too nearly. The Sindar   gave them the names Nogotheg 'Dwarf- let', or Nogoth 
niben 'Petty Dwarf'.(20)   <BR> The great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves, 
who were (it is said) the descendants of Dwarves who   had left or been 
driven our from the Communities, being deformed or undersized, or slothful and 
  rebellious. But they still acknowledged their kinship and resented any 
injuries done to them.   Indeed it was one of their grievances against the 
Eldar that they had hunted and slain their lesser   kin, who had settled in 
Beleriand before the Elves came there. This grievance was set aside, when 
  treaties were made between the Dwarves and the Sindar, in consideration of 
the plea that the   Petty-dwarves had never declared themselves to the Eldar, 
nor presented any claims to land or   habitations, but had at once attacked 
the newcomers in darkness and ambush. But the grievance still   smouldered, 
as was later seen in the case of Mim, the only Petty-dwarf who played a 
memorable part   in the Annals of Beleriand.     The Noldor, for use in 
Quenya, translated these Sindarin names for the Petty-dwarves by Attalyar 
  'Bipeds', and Pikinaukor or Pitya-naukor.

<BR> The opening paragraphs of this Appendix have been given in 
Morgoth's Ring p. 416 and are not   repeated here / Fr.170: here I restore it 
for the reader's convinience:   It is not here the place to debate the 
question of the origin of the Orcs. They were bred by   Melkor, and their 
breeding was the most wicked and lamentable of his works in Arda, but not the 
  most terrible. For clearly they were meant in his malice to be a mockery of 
the Children of   Iluvatar, wholly subservient to his will, and nursed in an 
unappeasable hatred of Elves and Men.   The Orcs of the later wars, after the 
escape of Melkor-Morgoth and his return to Middle-earth,   were neither 
spirits nor phantoms, but living creatures, capable of speech and of some crafts 
and   organization, or at least capable of learning such things from higher 
creatures or from their   Master. They bred and multiplied rapidly whenever 
left undisturbed. It is unlikely, as a   consideration of the ultimate origin 
of this race would make clearer, that the Quendi had met any   Orcs of this 
kind, before their finding by Oromл and the separation of Eldar and Avari. 
  But it is known that Melkor had become aware of the Quendi before the Valar 
began their war   against him, and the joy of the Elves in Middle-earth had 
already been darkened by shadows of fear.   Dreadful shapes had begun to 
haunt the borders of their dwellings, and some of their people   vanished 
into the darkness and were heard of no more. Some of these things may have been 
phantoms   and delusions; but some were, no doubt, shapes taken by the 
servants of Melkor, mocking and   degrading the very forms of the Children. 
For Melkor had in his service great numbers of the Maiar,   who had the 
power, as had their Master, of taking visible and tangible shape in Arda. - End 
of the   restored passage/.   The words that now follow, 'these shapes and 
the terror that they inspired', refer to the   'dreadful shapes' that haunted 
the dwellings of the Elves in the land of their awakening.     For these 
shapes and the terror that they inspired the element chiefly used in the ancient 
tongue   of the Elves appears to have been *RUKU. In all the Eldarin tongues 
(and, it is said, in the Avarin   also) there are many derivatives of this 
stem, having such ancient forms as: ruk-, rauk-, uruk-,   urk(u), runk-, 
rukut/s, besides the strengthened stem gruk-, and the elaborated guruk-, nguruk. 
  (Note 27, p. 415) Already in PQ that word must have been formed which had 
in CE the form *rauku or   *rauko. This was applied to the larger and more 
terrible of the enemy shapes. But ancient were also   the forms uruk, urku/o, 
and the adjectival urka 'horrible'. (Note 28, p. 415) In Quenya we meet the 
  noun urko, pl. urqui, deriving as the plural form shows from *urku or 
*uruku. In Sindarin is found   the corresponding urug; but there is in 
frequent use the form orch, which must be derived from   *urko or the 
adjectival *urka.     In the lore of the Blessed Realm the Q urko naturally 
seldom occurs, except in tales of the   ancient days and the March, and then 
is vague in meaning, referring to anything that caused fear to   the Elves, 
any dubious shape or shadow, or prowling creature. In Sindarin urug has a 
similar use.   It might indeed be translated 'bogey'. But the form orch seems 
at once to have been applied to the   Orcs, as soon as they appeared; and 
Orch, pl. Yrch, class-plural Orchoth remained the regular name   for these 
creatures in Sindarin afterwards. The kinship, though not precise equivalence, 
of S orch   to Q urko, urqui was recognized, and in Exilic Quenya urko was 
commonly used to translate S orch,   though a form showing the influence of 
Sindarin, orko, pl. orkor and orqui, is also often found.     These names, 
derived by various routes from the Elvish tongues, from Quenya, Sindarin, 
Nandorin,   and no doubt Avarin dialects, went far and wide, and seem to have 
been the source of the names for   the Orcs in most of the languages of the 
Elder Days and the early ages of which there is any   record. The form in 
Adunaic urku, urkhu may be direct from Quenya or Sindarin; and this form 
  underlies the words for Orc in the languages of Men of the North-West in 
the Second and Third Ages.   The Orcs themselves adopted it, for the fact 
that it referred to terror and detestation delighted   them. The word uruk 
that occurs in the Black Speech, devised (it is said) by Sauron to serve as a 
  lingua franca for his subjects, was probably borrowed by him from the 
Elvish tongues of earlier   times. It referred, however, specially to the 
trained and disciplined Orcs of the regiments of   Mordor. Lesser breeds seem 
to have been called snaga.(22)     The Dwarves claimed to have met and fought 
the Orcs long before the Eldar in Beleriand were aware   of them. It was 
indeed their obvious detestation of the Orcs, and their willingness to assist in 
  any war against them, that convinced the Eldar that the Dwarves were no 
creatures of Morgoth.   Nonetheless the Dwarvish name for Orcs, Rukhs, pl. 
Rakhas, seems to show affinity to the Elvish   names, and was possibly 
ultimately derived from Avarin.     The Eldar had many other names for the 
Orcs, but most of these were 'kennings', descriptive terms   of occasional 
use. One was, however, in frequent use in Sindarin: more often than Orchoth the 
  general name for Orcs as a race that appears in the Annals was Glamhoth. 
Glam meant 'din, uproar,   the confused yelling and bellowing of beasts', so 
that Glamboth in origin meant more or less 'the   Yelling-horde', with 
reference to the horrible clamour of the Orcs in battle or when in pursuit - 
  they could be stealthy enough at need. But Glamhoth became so firmly 
associated with Orcs that Glam   alone could be used of any body of Orcs, and 
a singular form was made from it, glamog. (Compare the   name of the sword 
Glamdring.) 
<BR>Note. The word used in translation of Q urko, S orch, is Orc. 
But that is because of the   similarity of the ancient English word orc, 
'evil spirit or bogey', to the Elvish words. There is   possibly no connexion 
between them. The English word is now generally supposed to be derived from 
  Latin Orcus. The word for Orc in the now forgotten tongue of the Druedain 
in the realm of Gondor is   recorded as being (? in the plural) gorgun. This 
is possibly derived ultimately from the Elvish   words.   <BR> Author's Notes 
to Quendi and Eldar.   <BR> Note 27 (p. 390). *(n)guruk is due to a combination 
of *(g)ruk with *NGUR 'horror', seen in S   gorth, gorthob 'horror, 
horrible', and (reduplicated) gorgor 'extreme horror'. <BR> Note 28 (p. 390) 
Some other derivatives are in Quenya: rukin 'I feel fear or horror' (constructed 
  with 'from' of the object feared); ruhta- 'terrify'; rukima 'terrible'; 
rauko and arauko &lt; *grauk-)   'a powerful, hostile, and terrible 
creature', especially in the compound Valarauko 'Demon of   Might', applied 
later to the more powerful and terrible of the Maia servants of Morgoth. In 
  Sindarin appear, for instance, raug and graug, and the com- pound Balrog 
(equivalents of Q rauko,   etc.); groga- 'feel terror'; gruitha 'terrify'; 
gorog (&lt; *guruk) 'horror'. <BR> /Comm. Note 22 by Christ.Tolk./. Cf. Appendix

          attempt. And these creatures, being filled with all malice and hatred, 
          so that they did not love even their own kind, had soon diversified 
          their barbarous and unwritten speech into as many jargons as there were 
          groups or settlements of Orcs. Thus they were driven to use the language 
          of their enemies even in conversing with other Orcs of  different breed 
          or distant dwellings. In the Misty Mountains, and in other lingering 
          Orc-holds in  the far North-west, they had indeed abandoned their native 
          tongue and used the Common Speech, though in such a fashion as to make 
          it scarcely less unlovely than the Orkish.  <BR><B>e.</B> PM (HME12)/1:1. The Appendix on Languages. Later Version,

          and even crossing their breed with that of the  larger Orcs. Trolls 
          thus took such language as they could from the Orcs, and in the west-lands

          F 4, still called The Languages of the Third Age but  changed to The 
          Languages and Peoples of the Third Age, followed the major revision 
          of 1951. My  father's long experimentation with the structure and expression 
          of this Appendix now issued in his  most lucid account of the Elvish 
          languages, in which the terms Sindar and Sindarin at last  appeared, 
          and the acquisition of the Grey-elven tongue by the exiled Noldor.

          new race of Trolls that appeared at the end of the Third Age. Here the 
          name was first Horg-hai, but changed as my father typed the text to 
          Olg-hai (Olog-hai in RK, p. 410). The account of them did not differ 
          from the final form except in the statement of their origin: That Sauron 
          bred them none doubted, though from what stock was not known. Some held 
          that they were a cross-breed between trolls and the larger Orcs; others 
          that they were indeed not trolls at all but giant Orcs. Yet there was 
          no kinship from  the beginning between the stone-trolls and the Orcs 
          that they might breed together;(Note 5 / Fr.195j/) while the Olg-hai 
          were in fashion of mind and body quite unlike even the largest of Orc-kind.

          Languages and Peoples of the Third Age. <BR>Orcs and the Black Speech. Orc is the form of the name that other races 
          had for this foul people  as it was in the language of Rohan. In Sindarin 
          it was orch. Related, no doubt, was the word uruk  of the Black Speech, 
          though this was applied as a rule only to the great soldier-orcs that 
          at this  time issued from Mordor and Isengard. The lesser kinds were 
          called, especially by the Uruk-hai,  snaga 'slave'. <BR>The Orcs were first bred by the Dark Power of the North in the Elder 
          Days. It is said that they bad no language of their own, but took what 
          they could of other tongues and perverted it to their own liking; yet 
          they made only brutal jargons, scarcely sufficient even for their own 
          needs, unless  it were for curses and abuse. And these creatures, being 
          filled with malice, hating even their own kind, quickly developed as 
          many barbarous dialects as there were groups or settlements of their 
          race, so that their Orkish speech was of little use to them in intercourse 
          between different tribes. So it was that in the Third Age Orcs used 
          for communication between breed and breed the Westron  tongue; and many 
          indeed of the older tribes, such as those that still lingered in the 
          North and in  the Misty Mountains, had long used the Westron as their 
          native language, though in such a fashion  as to make it hardly less 
          unlovely than Orkish. In this jargon tark, 'man of Gondor', was a debased 
           form of tarkil, a Quenya word used in Westron for one of Numenorean 
          descent; see III. It is said that the Black Speech was devised by Sauron 
          in the Dark Years, and that he bad desired to make it the language of 
          all those that served him, but he failed in that purpose. From the Black 
          Speech, however, were derived many of the words that were in the Third 
          Age wide-spread among the Orcs, such as ghвsh 'fire', but after the 
          first overthrow of Sauron this language in its ancient  form was forgotten 
          by all but the Nazgul. When Sauron arose again, it became once more 
          the language of Barad-dur and of the captains of Mordor. The inscription 
          on the Ring was in the ancient Black Speech, while the curse of the 
          Mordor-orc in II, 53. was in the more debased form used by the soldiers 
          of the Dark Tower, of whom Grishnаkh was the captain. Sharku in that 
          tongue means old man. Trolls. Troll has been used to translate the Sindarin 
          Torog. In their beginning far back in the twilight of the Elder Days, 
          these were creatures of dull and lumpish nature and had no more language 
          than beasts. But Sauron had made use of them, teaching them what little 
          they could learn,  and increasing their wits with wickedness. Trolls 
          therefore took such language as they could master  from the Orcs; and 
          in the Westlands the Stone-trolls spoke a debased form of the Common 
          Speech.  But at the end of the Third Age a troll-race not before seen 
          appeared in southern Mirkwood and in  the mountain borders of Mordor. 
          Olog-hai they were called in the Black Speech. That Sauron bred  them 
          none doubted, though from what stock was not known. Some held that they 
          were not Trolls but  giant Orcs; but the Olog-hai were in fashion of 
          body and mind quite unlike even the largest of  Orc-kind, whom they 
          far surpassed in size and power. Trolls they were, but filled with the 
          evil  will of their master: a fell race, strong, agile, fierce and cunning, 
          but harder than stone. Unlike  the older race of the Twilight they could 
          endure the Sun, so long as the will of Sauron held sway  over them. 
          They spoke little, and the only tongue that they knew was the Black 
          Speech of Barad-dur. 
        <P align="justify"><B>l.</B> The Lord of the Rings. Appendix F II. On 
          Translation. <BR>But Orcs and Trolls spoke as they would, without love of words or things; 
          and their language was  actually more degraded and filthy than I have 
          shown it I do not suppose that any will wish for a  closer rendering, 
          though models are easy to find. Much the same sort of talk can still 
          be heard  among the orc-minded; dreary and repetitive with hatred and 
          contempt, too long removed from good to  retain even verbal vigour, 
          save in the ears of those to whom only the squalid sounds strong.

Orcs again multiply in secret and occupy many deep places (especially those 
<BR>anciently made by the Dwarves) in the Misty Mountains. They do this so 
stealthily that none are   aware of it, until they have great forces hidden 
and are ready to bar all the passes from Eriador   into Anduin's vales,

scattered Dwarves of Durin's race gather together   out of the North and make 
war on the Orcs of the Misty Mountains. The War of the Dwarves and Orcs   was 
long and terrible and fought largely in the dark in deep places.

<BR>Note 35. In very difficult scribbled notes at the end of T 3 my father 
asked himself: 'When were   the Dwarf and Goblin wars? When did Moria become 
finally desolate?' He noted that since the wars   were referred to by Thorin 
in The Hobbit they 'must have been recent', and suggested that there was 
  'an attempt to enter Moria in Thrain's time', perhaps 'an expedition from 
Erebor to Moria'. 'But   the appearance of the Balrog and the desolation of 
Moria must be more ancient, possibly as far back   as c.1980-2000'. He then 
wrote: 'After fall of Erebor Thror tried to visit Moria and was killed by   a 
goblin. The dwarves assembled a force and fought Orcs on east side of Moria and 
did great   slaughter, but could not enter Moria because of "the terror". 
Dain returns to the Iron Hills, but   Thorin and Thrain wander about.' 
Entries were then added to the text of T 3 which were taken up   into T 4. At 
this time the story was that Thrain and Thorin accompanied Thror, but made their 
  escape. - Much later the dates of the war were changed from 2766-9 to 
2793-9.
