      <P align=justify><BR><A name=comm1></A><b>Задачи и структура настоящей работы.</b><BR><BR>Наша цель - снабдить читателя, 
интересующегося историей и культурой орков, полным сводом фрагментов 
толкиеновского корпуса, имеющих отношение к этой проблеме. Фрагменты приводятся 
в общем порядке следования HME 1-12, Silmarillion, UT, LR: Appendices, прочие 
мелкие материалы, LR: основной текст, Hobbit. Этот порядок определяется 
последовательность издания серии HME и сравнительной важностью остальных 
материалов. Иногда параллельные фрагменты разных текстов приводятся рядом друг с 
другом.<BR><BR>Каждый фрагмент вводится номером и указанием источника, например: 
Fr.1. BLT 1/3. /Lost Story III/ The Coming of Valar and the Building of Valinor, 
где вначале указывается в сокращенном виде том (см. список сокращений), а потом 
полностью сказание, входящее в него и содержащее фрагмент. Все тексты от 
составителя берутся в косые скобки / /; весь прочий текст принадлежит 
толкиеновскому корпусу. Пометка /Comm./ означает, что нижеследующий текст 
является комментарием Кристофера Толкиена с возможным включением пересказа или 
цитат текста Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена, помета /Rend./ означает, что нижеследующий текст 
является пересказом или изложением рукописи Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена, сделанным 
Кристофером Толкиеном, с элементами цитат подлинного текста Дж.Р.Р. или без 
таковых. Помета /Autocomm./ подразумевает попытку Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена понять и 
интерпретировать неясные ему самому стороны собственного мира; такие 
автокомментарии (учитывая, к тому же, неоднократные заявления Толкиена о том, 
что ему самому этот мир не вполне понятен и не особенно подвластен) не могут 
рассматриваться как "источники" по Арде. Толкиен выступает здесь не как 
"Толкиен", а как "толкиенист" - автор внешнего и гипотетического комментария к 
собственному тексту/миру. Тексты без помет (за исключением самоочевидных 
случаев) являются собственными текстами Дж.Р.Р.Толкиена "источникового" 
характера.<BR><BR>Особую проблему представляют собой указания страниц. Дело в 
том, что все толкиеновские тексты издавались неоднократно разными 
издательствами, как в большом формате, так и "пэйпербэками". Если сам текст 
Толкиена воспроизводится во всех изданиях совершенно одинаково, то распределение 
страниц, естественно, различное. Мало того, внутренние постраничные отсылки, 
содержащиеся в самом толкиеновском тексте, одни издания механически 
воспроизводят в их первоначальном виде, рассчитанном на пользование 
"Сильмариллионом" 1977 г. и Унвиновским первоизданием UT и HME в толстых 
переплетах, а другие пытаются их переправлять, отсылая к изданиям собственной 
серии и тем создавая безмерную путаницу. Я принял решение всюду, где можно, 
избегать ссылок на страницы, указывая вместо этого как можно точнее ту или иную 
часть текста; при крайней же необходимости указывать либо страницы унвиновского 
большеформатного издания (по умолчанию), либо страницы доступного иного издания 
(с указанием последнего). Тот, кто работает с любым изданием, легко сможет найти 
в нем нужную страницу, просто посмотрев по печатному индексу, на каких страницах 
указанной мной структурной части текста встречается ключевое слово фрагмента. 
Кроме того, если внутренняя ссылка дается на текст, который уже был приведен 
мной в качестве одного из фрагментов, я, как правило, привожу, наряду с номером 
страницы, номер соответствующего фрагмента в настоящем собрании. Вообще, 
настоящая сводка рассчитана прежде всего на то, чтобы ее и использовали, 
ссылаясь на номера фрагментов, а не на номера соответствующих страниц по какому 
бы то ни было изданию.<BR>Чем полезна работа такого типа? Прежде всего тем, что, 
загрузив ее и применяя простейший контекстный поиск, можно в течение 10 минут 
получить информацию, которую пришлось бы часами выбирать из печатных изданий 
(даже при условии, что все они у Вас есть). <BR><BR>В свою очередь, получив ее, 
можно довольно быстро решить проблемы, трудноразрешимые при обращении к 
отдельным текстам. Приведу только один пример: вопрос о соотношении "орков" и 
"гоблинов". Иногда эти термины выступают как совершенно совпадающие по смыслу 
обозначения орков; иногда - как обозначения двух разных, непересекающихся типов 
существ; иногда "орки" оказываются разновидностью "гоблинов". Сопоставление всех 
контекстов позволяет довольно быстро прийти к выводу о том, что<BR><BR>- 1. 
Самое раннее, еще нейтральное значение термина "гоблин" примерно совпадает со 
значением термина "фэй" - представители "малого народца", низшего 
мифологического уровня в целом. В этом смысле даже эльфы-нолдор оказываются 
"гоблинами", как о том прямо свидетельствует редкое употребление терминов 
"Gnome" и "goblin" как взаимозаменяемых (см. ниже, Fr.5)!<BR><BR>-2. В более 
узком и основном смысле первоначально гоблинами называлась всякая мелкая и 
средняя "нечисть" (точный перевод английского слова "гоблины" на русский язык) 
на службе Мелькора. Критерием выделения этой группы были относительно небольшие 
силы и размеры. Орки "сформировались" достаточно независимо от этих "гоблинов" и 
были крупнее и сильнее их, так что первоначально их строго различали.<BR><BR>- 2 
&gt; 3. С другой стороны, орки были ненамного крупнее и сильнее, и достаточно 
походили на гоблинов с виду, чтобы при смешанных и совместных действиях 
восприниматься как их часть/часть некоего единства; возможно, они смешивались и 
физически и имели какие-то общие корни (например, в рамках общности "гоблинов" в 
первом, самом широком и нейтральном смысле слова). Тем самым орки стали 
восприниматься как часть/разновидность мелкоровых гоблинов (3).<BR><BR>- 3 &gt; 
4. При этом, поскольку они были все-таки самыми сильными и, возможно, самыми 
многочисленными из "гоблинов" в этом новом, третьем смысле слова, они стали 
восприниматься еще и как главная их часть, "гоблины" par excellence (4). Тем 
самым термин "гоблин" начинает применяться как простое обозначение 
"орка".<BR><BR>- 4 &gt; 5. Впоследствии все прочие "гоблины" отошли в тень(не то 
вымерли, не то смешались с орками, не то вышли из всех конфликтов и так 
затаились, что больше их никакие источники не упоминают - во всяком случае, 
после Первой эпохи они полностью исчезают из текстов), и единственными 
"гоблинами" на виду источников остались "орки". Термин "гоблин" становится 
абсолютным синонимом к термину "орк" (5).<BR><BR>Заметим, что одинаковая 
принадлежность нолдор и орков к "гоблинам" в широком смысле слова (в 
словоупотреблении людей) согласуется с эльфийским происхождением орков, хотя и 
не подразумевает его категорически.<BR><BR>Толкиенисты с "историческим уклоном" 
(а есть и с литературным, и с литведческим, и с этико-философским, и с 
онтологическим, и с гносеологическим, и с географическим, и с антропологическим, 
и с лингвистическим - вот только с чисто естественнонаучным уклоном толкиенистов 
нет и быть не может, JRRT был гуманитарий и просто не оставил в этой области 
достаточно пищи для сердца и ума; все рассуждения на тему о возможных 
нейролингвистических и акустических механизмах речи у говорящих орлов или 
оптических свойствах палантиров были и останутся очень вымученными) весьма четко 
делятся на две - правда, пересекающиеся - категории. Одни радуются, когда 
начинают более цельно и живо представлять себе, что творилось - вернее, могло 
твориться - на душе у феанорингов, когда они шли громить Гавань Сириона. Это, 
так сказать, микроисторики от ардоведения. Если выяснится, как соотносятся друг 
с другом "гоблины", "гонги", "орки", "каукарэльдар", "изначальные фэйри" и "злые 
фэйри", это их не огорчит и не обрадует. Другие радуются в точности таким вещам 
(третьи - тем и другим); это макроисторики, и именно для них предназначается 
данная работа.<BR><BR>В нижеследующий корпус включались фрагменты, помогающие 
выявить:<BR>место орков среди других живых существ Арды (в эту категорию входят 
также фрагменты, описывающие иные категории существ, чем-то сходных с орками, и 
перечни или классификации, где орки упоминаются среди других рас);<BR>место 
орков в составе сил Тьмы (сюда приходится включать и описания битв, упоминающие 
разные виды этих сил, и устойчивые формулы типа "орки и 
балроги");<BR>происхождение и расогенез орков, возможности их скрещивания с 
другими расами, внешность и вооружение орков;<BR>отношение орков к иным 
существам, в том числе своим властителям;<BR>сообщества орков, автономные или 
независимые от власти Мелькора и Саурона;<BR>орки с точки зрения эрувианской 
теологии и ее производных, как их гипотетически интерпретировал и пытался 
применить в автокомментариях сам Толкиен.<BR><BR>P.S. Орки "Властелина 
Колец".<BR>Обычно "Властелин Колец" рассматривается чуть ли не как самый 
достоверный и подробный источник по облику и поведению различных рас Арды. Этот 
взгляд, при всей своей распространенности, не выдерживает ни малейшей критики. 
Что такое "ВК"? В пределах мира Толкиена это - сделанный самим Толкиеном перевод 
"Красной Книги Западной Марки", а точнее, романа, написанного неизвестными 
людьми Арнорско-Гондорского королевства на основе этой самой "Красной Книги", 
которая, в свою очередь, представляла собой компиляцию, основанную на записях 
Бильбо и Фродо, в течение столетий дополнявшихся и переправлявшихся как 
хоббитами Шира, так и гондорскими учеными (RFCG, s.v. Red Book of Westmarch). 
Тем самым настоящих голосов героев Войны Кольца мы в ВК вообще НЕ СЛЫШИМ и 
слышать не можем. Мыслимо ли, к примеру, чтобы Сэм точно зафиксировал в памяти 
все реплики Шаграта и Горбага, потом так же точно бы их надиктовал Фродо, тот 
так же точно их записал, а потом при многосотлетней переработке текста с ними 
ничего бы не случилось? Итак, все реплики орков (как и все конкретные реплики 
кого бы то ни было, как и вообще все, кроме сюжетной канвы) - это не стенограмма 
и не свидетельство очевидца, а "фукидидова речь" - то есть всего лишь 
реконструкция того, КАК И ЧТО МОГЛИ БЫ ГОВОРИТЬ ОРКИ ПО МНЕНИЮ "светлых" авторов 
и обработчиков исходных хоббитских записей. Ни подробного описания деталей, ни 
психологических характеристик, ни записей всех разговоров авторы первоисточника 
ВК - хоббиты "Братства" - составить и оставить не могли вообще, так что все это 
было досочинено и унифицировано потом - по существующим в уме авторов конечного 
ВК моделям. А эти модели предусматривали совершенно четкое отношение к оркам 
(которых к тому же те, кто писал орочьи диалоги ВК, уже несколько веков как не 
видели живьем). Портрет орков в ВК, сообщает нам нечто не об орках, а об авторах 
конечного ВК - о том, какими орков представляли себе эти "светлые" авторы сотни 
лет спустя. В этой связи весьма характерно, что уже "Хоббит" - текст, гораздо 
ближе стоящий к своему первоисточнику, то есть записям Бильбо - рисует орков 
куда более живо и в несколько ином свете, чем "ВК".<BR><BR>P.S.2. Орки на 
стороне Последнего Союза? <BR>Иногда это постулируют на основании, казалось бы, 
бесспорного пассажа из "Сильмариллиона", трактат "О Кольцах Власти и Третьей 
Эпохе": /Во время войны Последнего Союза/ All living things were divided in that 
day, and some of every kind, even of beasts and birds, were found in either 
host, save the Elves only. They alone were undivided and followed Gil-galad. 
Казалось бы, отсюда следует, что во время Войны Последнего Союза разделились и 
орки; однако в письмах и эссе Толкиена разъяснения на эту тему выдержаны в том 
духе, что орки от начала и до конца служат Злу (Fr.170, Fr.252, Fr.260). 
Разгадка проста. В процитированном отрывке речь идет о позиции living things, 
"живых существ". Между тем в толкиеновском корпусе присутствует два 
несовместимых взгляда на орков по этому вопросу: по одному, это действительно 
живые существа (так, например, прямо в Fr.194, где орки причислены именно к 
living things), по другому - нечто вроде биороботов, псевдожизнь, созданная 
Мелькором, который настоящей жизни творить в принципе не мог (Fr. 26, 76, 103 и 
др.). Повествование "О Кольцах Власти..." (в отличие от других частей совершенно 
компилятивного итогового "Сильмариллиона", которые, к слову сказать, в вопросе о 
происхождении орков несогласны и друг с другом) исходит, несомненно, из второй 
концепции (чему есть и другие доказательства), и их "living things" просто не 
относится к оркам. Ср. об этом прямо: If any Orcs surrendered and asked for 
mercy, they must be granted it, even at a cost.** [**footnote to the text: Few 
Orcs ever did so in the Elder Days, and at no time would any Orc treat with any 
Elf], Fr.170, Orcs IIIa. Эта фраза полностью исключает участие орков в Последнем 
Союзе с эльфами. - Сравнительно недавно было высказано предположение, что орки 
все же имеются в виду в рассматриваемом пассаже в числе "живых существ", и что 
разделение распространяется и на них. Объяснять это, согласно автору указанного 
предположения, можно тем, что какая-то группа (группы) орков, не заключая, 
разумеется, союза с эльфами, могли выступать в союзе с определенным сообществом 
дварфов или людей (такие союзы и в самом деле зарегистрированы в источниках), а 
те, в свою очередь, по сугубо военно-политическим причинам могли, даже не 
блокируясь с Последним Союзом, а на свой страх и риск, вне какого-либо 
противостояния с Тьмой как целым, воевать с каким-то отрядом, принадлежащим к 
коалиции Саурона. Кроме того, орки могли воевать друг с другом, и вполне могло 
быть так, что одна из сталкивающихся групп орков входила в силы Саурона, а 
другая была самостоятельна и жила на свой страх и риск. В приведенных выше 
ситуациях получилось бы, что какие-то орки "объективно" выступали против сил 
Саурона, что, по мысли авторов рассматриваемого предположения, и могло бы дать 
нашему источнику право распространять представление о "разделившихся" во время 
Войны Последнего Союза существах и на орков. Согласиться с этим нельзя, так как 
процитированное выше место трактата "О Кольцах Власти и Третьей Эпохе" говорит 
не просто об "объективном" распределении сил, а о таком разделении каждой 
разновидности "живых существ" (кроме эльфов), при котором часть из них 
обнаруживалась в "каждом (из двух противоборствовавших) воинств" (host). Между 
тем ясно, что орки не могли присутствовать в "воинстве" (host) Последнего Союза 
(см. выше), а если какая-то группа орков и действовала против каких-то сил 
Саурона на свой страх и риск, не входя при этом в Воинство Последнего Союза, то 
этот факт в любом случае не учитывался бы и не покрывался рассматриваемой фразой 
трактата "О Кольцах Власти…": последний учитывает только те случаи, когда одни 
представители одного и того же вида "living things" служили в одном из hosts 
(Гил-Галада - Элендила или Саурона), а другие - в другом. Остается считать, что 
составители трактата "О Кольцах власти" не числили орков среди "living things". 
<BR><BR>PS 3. Грудные орчата на воспитании у эльфов? <BR>Дм. Виноходов любезно 
сообщил нам следующее: "Листая старые подшивки эхо-конференции SU.TOLKIEN, я 
обнаружил в одном из посланий Андрея Ленского (ноябрь 1995 г.) цитату на 
английском языке с чрезвычайно интересной информацией. В письме было сказано, 
что цитата эта из письма Толкина, однако в сборнике писем я этого фрагмента не 
нашел, более того, сам Андрей уже не помнит, откуда он эту цитату взял. Никто из 
тех, к кому я обращался, не смог назвать источник цитаты. Были высказаны лишь 
предположения, что это цитата из какого-то руководства по играм. /.../ Вот эта 
цитата:<BR><BR>"...Female orcs are similar to males, and they often go to war 
with orc bands. Because they are shorter and thinner, most of them are snaga. 
Neither human nor orc from different tribe can distinguish them. Some of them 
carry children in backpacks. When orc with child is slain, other orcs kill 
child.<BR>...<BR>Littles [маленькие орчата, мать которых убили в бою - A/ндрей/ 
L/енский/] were often given to elves, and became elves themselves. But they have 
instinctive hatred to orcs, and elves could do nothing with it".<BR><BR>Огромное 
количество писем Толкиена в сборнике его писем не опубликовано, но в разные 
времена публиковались фрагментами в газетных и журнальных статях, комментаторами 
и в специальных журналах. Просмотреть все это и проверить таким образом, 
толкиеновская ли это цитата - совершенно невозможно. К.Кинн, стоявшая у истоков 
обсуждения этой цитаты еще в начале 1990-х, указала нам, что это отрывок из 
англоязычного FAQ или из архивов англоязычной же конференции alt.tolkien конца 
80-х - начала 90-х гг., причем присутствовала ли ссылка на "письмо Толкиена" там 
с самого начала и была ли она достоверна, неизвестно; таким образом, цитата 
может принадлежать и фэнам, и ролевикам. По экспертной оценке К.Кинн и Эли 
Бар-Яалома (Хатуля) текст не толкиеновский, и существует решающий аргумент в 
пользу такой оценки: в тексте стоит Because they (орчанки) are shorter and 
thinner, most of them are snaga. "Так как оркские самки ниже и тоньше самцов, 
большинство из них - снаги". Здесь "снага" - это экстерьерная категория орков, 
"особи определенного (меньшего) роста и массивности". Так мог бы понять Толкиена 
читатель при беглом восприятии его текста, но так никогда бы написал сам 
Толкиен: у него "снаги" - это определенные племена/породы (breeds) орков, 
характеризующиеся более низким ростом и меньшей массивностью - племена или 
породы, а не особи ( Fr.192)! Толкиен мог бы написать "большинство оркских самок 
- снаги, ибо они низки ростом и тонки" не с большей вероятностью, чем 
"большинство самок павлина - домашние куры, ибо не имеют разноцветных хвостов". 
Таким образом, цитата фэнская, а не толкиеновская, и мы не помещаем ее в корпус. 
(Задним числом можно найти и еще одно доказательство: если бы Толкиен считал 
эльфов столь благостными, он отразил бы это не раз и не два в самых разных 
текстах и разговорах /и Кристофер не преминул бы это упомянуть/, а не оставил бы 
столь ярко рисующую благородство эльфов черту для одноразового упоминания в 
неидентифицированном и не использованном его публикаторами письме)

ogres', have been mentioned in an earlier tale, /HME 1/ pp. 75-6 /= Fr.1/); and 
Tuvo protected Men and Elves from them and from 'evil fays'. A makes mention of 
Orcs besides.<BR>A servant of Melko named 'Fukil or Fangli' entered the world, 
and coming among Men perverted them, so that they fell treacherously upon the 
Ilkorins; there followed the Battle of Palisor, in which the people of Ermon 
fought beside Nuin. According to A 'the fays and those Men that aided them were 
defeated', but B calls it an 'undecided battle', and the Men corrupted by Fangli 
fled away and became 'wild and savage tribes', worshipping Fangli and Melko. 
Thereafter (in A only) Palisor was possessed by 'Fangli and his hosts of 
Nauglath (or Dwarves)'. (In the early writings the Dwarves are always portrayed 
as an evil people.) From this outline it is seen that the corruption of certain 
Men in the beginning of their days by the agency of Melko was a feature of the 
earliest phase of the mythology; but of all the story here sketched there is no 
more than a hint or suggestion, at most, in The Silmarillion (p. 141): ' "A 
darkness lies behind us," Beor said; "and we have turned our backs upon it, and 
we do not desire to return thither even in thought."<BR><BR><b>Fr.3</b><BR>/HME I.

Uvanimor had escaped when the Gods broke the Fortress of the North, and were 
wandering in the forests; Fankil servant of Melko dwelt uncaptured in the world. 
(Fankil = Fangli /Fukil of A and B. In C he is called 'child of Melko'. Fankil 
has been mentioned at an earlier point in D, when at the time of the Awakening 
of the Elves 'Fankil and many dark shapes escaped into the world'; see /HME1/ p. 
107, note 3) /.../ /After having been awakened by Elves/ Men dwelt in the centre 
of the world and spread thence in all directions; and a very great age passed. 
/Then/ Fankil with the Dwarves and Goblins went among Men, and bred estrangement 
between them and the Elves; and many Men aided the Dwarves. The folk of Ermon 
alone stood by the fairies in the first war of Goblins and Elves (Goblins is 
here an emendation from Dwarves, and that from Men), which is called the War of 
Palisor. Nuin died at the hands of the Goblins through the treachery of Men. 
Many kindreds of Men were driven to the eastern deserts and the southern 
forests, whence came dark and savage peoples.<BR><BR><b>Fr.4</b><BR>/HME I. P.239 +

Battle of Unnumbered Tears': Melko fostered distrust and kept them spying on 
each other, so that they should not combine against him; and he fashioned the 
false-fairies or Kaukareldar in their likeness, and these deceived and betrayed 
Men10.<BR>/.../ Note 10. The text has here the bracketed word '(Gongs)'. This 
might be thought to be a name for the Kaukareldar or 'false-fairies', but in the 
Gnomish word-list Gong is defined as 'one of a tribe of the Orcs, a goblin'.

Mannish Tradition/ <BR>There were 'Enkeladim' /Elves/ once on earth, but that 
was not their name in this world: it was Eledai (in Numenorean Eldar).(1) After 
the First Fall they tried to befriend Men, and teach them to love the Earth and 
all things that grow in it. But evil also was ever at work. There were false 
Eldar: counterfeits and deceits made by evil, ghosts and goblins, but not always 
evil to look at. They terrified Men, or else deceived and betrayed them, and 
hence arose the fear of Men for all the spirits of the Earth. <BR>Men 'awoke' 
first in the midst of the Great Middle Earth (Europe and Asia), and Asia was 
first thinly inhabited, before the Dark Ages of great cold. Even before that 
time Men had spread westward (and eastward) as far as the shores of the Sea. The 
[Enkeladim &gt;] Eledai withdrew into waste places or retreated westward.(2) The 
Men who journeyed westward were in general those who remained in closest touch 
with the true Eledai, and for the most part they were drawn west by the rumour 
of a land in or beyond the Western Sea which was beautiful, and was the home of 
the Eledai where all things were fair and ordered to beauty. This was so for 
there was a great island in the Ocean where the Eledai had first 'awakened' when 
the world was made: that is complete and ready for their operations. Thus it is 
that the more beautiful legends (containing truths) arose, of oreads, dryads, 
and nymphs; and of the Ljos-alfar.(3) <BR>NOTES. 1. The name Eledai occurs in 
Drowning of Anadune (and subsequent texts) §5 / Fr.41v/, as the name of the 
Nimri (Nimir) in their own language./.../ 2. Sketch I has here: 'The Great 
Central Land, Europe and Asia, was first inhabited. Men awoke in Mesopotamia. 
Their fates as they spread were very various. But the Enkeladim withdrew ever 
west.' 3. Ljos-alfar: Old Norse, 'Light-elves', mentioned in the 'Prose Edda' of

Beren addresses Melko as 'most mighty Belcha Morgoth', which are said to be his 
names among the Gnomes (/HME 2/ p. 44). In the Gnomish dictionary Belcha 
is-given as the Gnomish form corresponding to Melko (see /HME/ I. 260), but 
Morgoth is not found in it: indeed this is the first and only appearance of the 
name in the Lost Tales. The element goth is given in the Gnomish dictionary with 
the meaning 'war, strife'; but if Morgoth meant at this period 'Black Strife' it 
is perhaps strange that Beren should use it in a flattering speech. A name-list 
made in the 1930-s explains Morgoth as 'formed from his Orc-name Goth "Lord or 
Master" with mor "dark or black" prefixed', but it seems very doubtful that this 
etymology is valid for the earlier period. This name-list explains Gothmog 
'Captain of Balrogs' as containing the same Orc-element ('Voice of Goth 
(Morgoth)'); but in the name-list to the tale of The Fall Condolin (p. 216) the 
name Gothmog is said to mean 'Strife-and-hatred' (mog- 'detest, hate' appears in

The slaying of Clorund (pp. 103 -- 8). In this section I follow the narrative of 
the tale as far as Turin's swoon when the dying dragon opened his eyes and 
looked at him. Here the later story runs very close to the old, but there are 
many interesting differences. In the tale Glorund is said to have had bands of 
both Orcs and Noldoli subject to him / Fr.20/, but only the Orcs remained 
afterwards; cf. the Narn p. 125: Now the power and malice of Glaurung grew 
apace, and he waxed fat [cf. 'the Foaloke waxed fat'], and he gathered Orcs to 
him, and ruled as a dragon-King, and all the realm of Nargothrond that had been

rejected narrative there is a short outline headed 'Story of the Nauglafring or 
the Necklace of the Dwarves', and this also was struck through. Here there is no 
mention of Urin /Hurin/ at all, but it is told that the Orcs (emended from 
Gongs, see /HME/ I. 245 note 10 / Fr.4, note/) who guarded the treasury of 
Glorund went in search of him when he did not come back to the caves, and in 
their absence Tintoglin (i.e. Tinwelint), learning of Glorund's death, sent 
Elves to steal thehoard of the Rothwarin (i.e. Rodothlim). The Orcs returning 
cursed the thieves, and they cursed the gold also. Linwe (i.e. Tinwelint) 
guarded the gold, and he had a great necklace made by certain Uvanimor (Nautar 
or Nauglath). (Uvanimor have been defined in an earlier tale as 'monsters, 
giants, and ogres', see /HME/ I. 75, 236 /Frr.1,2/; Nauglath are Dwarves, /HME/ 
I. 236). In this Necklace the Silmaril was set; but the curse of the gold was on 
him, and he defrauded them of part of their reward. The Nauglath plotted, and 
got aid of Men; Linwe was slain in a raid, and the gold carried 
away.<BR><BR><b>Fr.23</b><BR>/HME 2. P.136/<BR>BLT2/2 Lost Story 2-2. /Comm./ /Rend./ 
The Necklace of the Dvarves /Cont.of Fr.22/<BR>There follows another rejected 
outline, headed 'The Necklace of the Dwarves', and this combines features of the 
preceding outline with features of the rejected ending of Eltas' narrative (pp. 
135 -- 6). Here Urin gathers a band of Elves and Men who are wild and fierce, 
and they go to the caves, which are lightly guarded because the 'Orqui' (i.e. 
Orcs) are abroad seeking Glorund. They carry off the treasure, and the Orcs 
returning curse it. Urin casts the treasure before the king and reproaches him 
(saying that he might have sent a greater company to the caves to secure the 
treasure, if not to aid Mavwin in her distress); 'Tintoglin would not touch it 
and bid Urin hold what he had won, but Urin would depart with bitter words'. 
Urin's men were not willing to leave it, and they sneaked back; there was an 
affray in the king's halls, and much blood was spilt on the gold. The outline 
concludes thus: The Gongs sack Linwe's halls and Linwe is slain and the gold is 
carried far away. Beren Ermabwed falls upon them at a crossing of Sirion and the 
treasure is cast into the water, and with it the Silmaril of Feanor. The 
Nauglath that dwell nigh dive after the gold but only one mighty necklace of 
gold (and that Silmaril is on it) do they find. This becomes a mark of their 
king.<BR><BR><BR><b>Fr.24</b><BR>/HME 2. P.156/<BR>BLT2/3 Lost Story 2-3. The Fall of

the getting of ore, and straying in the mountains alone was taken by some of the 
Orcs prowling there, and they would do him evil and terrible hurt, knowing him 
to be a man of the Gondothlim.<BR>This was however unknown of Tuor's watchers. 
But evil came into the heart of Meglin, and he said to his captors: "Know then 
that I am Meglin son of Eol who had to wife Isfin sister of Turgon king of the 
Gondothlim." But they said: "What is that to us?" And Meglin answered: "Much is 
it to you; for if you slay me, be it speedy or slow, ye will lose great tidings 
concerning the city of Gondolin that your master would rejoice to hear." Then 
the Orcs stayed their hands, and said they would give him life if the matters he 
opened to them seemed to merit that; and Meglin told them of all the fashion of 
that plain and city, of its walls and their height and thickness, and the valour 
of its gates; of the host of men at arms who now obeyed Turgon he spake, and the 
countless hoard of weapons gathered for their equipment, of the engines of war 
and the venomous fires. <BR>Then the Orcs were wroth, and having heard these 
matters were yet for slaying him there and then as one who impudently enlarged 
the power of his miserable folk to the mockery of the great might and puissance 
of Melko; but Meglin catching at a straw said: "Think ye not that ye would 
rather pleasure your master if ye bore to his feet so noble a captive, that he 
might hear my tidings of himself and judge of their verity?"<BR>Now this seemed 
good to the Orcs, and they returned from the mountains about Gondolin to the 
Hills of Iron and the dark halls of Melko; thither they haled Meglin with them, 
and now was he in a sore dread. But when he knelt before the black throne of 
Melko in terror of the grimness of the shapes about him, of the wolves that sat 
beneath that chair and of the adders that twined about its legs, Melko bade him 
speak. Then told he those tidings, and Melko hearkening spake very fair to him, 
that the insolence of his heart in great measure returned. Now the end of this 
was that Melko aided by the cunning of Meglin devised a plan for the overthrow 
of Gondolin. For this Meglin's reward was to be a great captaincy among the Orcs 
- yet Melko purposed not in his heart to fulfil such a promise - but Tuor and 
Earendel should Melko burn, and Idril be given to Meglin's arms - and such 
promises was that evil one fain to redeem.Yet as meed of treachery did Melko 
threaten Meglin with the torment of the Balrogs. Now these were demons with 
whips of flame and claws of steel by whom he tormented those of the Noldoli who 
durst withstand him in anything -- and the Eldar have called them Malkarauki. 
But the rede that Meglin gave to Melko was that not all the host of the Orcs nor 
the Balrogs in their fierceness might by assault or siege hope ever to overthrow 
the walls and gates of Gondolin even if they availed to win unto the plain 
without. Therefore he counselled Melko to devise out of his sorceries a succour 
for his warriors in their endeavour. From the greatness of his wealth of metals 
and his powers of fire he bid him make beasts like snakes and dragons of 
irresistible might that should overcreep the Encircling Hills and lap that plain 
and its fair city in flame and death.<BR><BR><b>Fr.28</b><BR>/HME 2. P.170/<BR>BLT2/3

most cunning smiths and sorcerers, and of iron and flame they wrought a host of 
monsters such as have only at that time been seen and shall not again be till 
the Great End. Some were all of iron so cunningly linked that they might flow 
like slow rivers of metal or coil themselves around and above all obstacles 
before them, and these were filled in their innermost depths with the grimmest 
of the Orcs with scimitars and spears; others of bronze and copper were given 
hearts and spirits of blazing fire, and they blasted all that stood before them 
with the terror of their snorting or trampled whatso escaped the ardour of their 
breath; yet others were creatures of pure flame that writhed like ropes of 
molten metal, and they brought to ruin whatever fabric they came nigh, and iron

bred of the subterranean heats and slime.' There is no trace yet of the later 
view that 'naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance of life, could 
ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the Ainulindale before the Beginning', 
or that the Orcs were derived from enslaved Quendi after the Awakening (The 
Silmarillion p. 50). Conceivably there is a first hint of this idea of their 
origin in the words of the tale in the same passage: 'unless it be that certain 
of,the Noldoli were twisted to the evil of Melko and mingled among these Orcs', 
although of course this is as it stands quite distinct from the idea that the 
Orcs were actually bred from Elves. Here also occurs the name Glamhoth of the 
Orcs, a name that reappears in the later Tuor (pp. 39 and 54 note

'enspelled' or blindly carrying forward the mysterious dictates of a curse,

altogether more ignoble than they afterwards became, more prone to evil to gain 
their ends, and more exclusively impelled by greed; that Doriath should be laid 
waste by mercenary Orcs under Dwarvish paymasters (/HME 2/ p. 230 / Fr.36/) was 
to become incredible and impossible later. It is even said that by the deeds of 
Naugladur 'have the Dwarves been severed in feud for ever since those days with 
the Elves, and drawn more nigh in friendship to the kin of Melko' (/HME 2/ p.

'Bal meaneth evilness, and Balc evil, and Balrog meaneth evil demon.' GL has 
balc 'cruel'. see /HME/ I. 250 (Balrog).<BR>/P.340/ Glamhoth GL defines this as 
'name given by the Goldothrim to the Orcin: People of Dreadful Hate' (cf. 'folk

element is glam 'hatred, loathing'; other words are glamri 'bitter feud', glamog 
'loathsome'. An entry in NFG says: 'Glam meaneth "fierce hate" and even as Gwar 
has no kindred words in Eldar.' For hoth 'folk' see I. 264 (orchoth in entry 
Orc), and cf. Goldothrim, Gondothlim, Rumhoth, Thornhoth. Under root HOSO QL 
gives hos 'folk', hosse' 'army, band, troop', hostar 'tribe', horma 'horde,

Арде особых древнейших "даймонов"-фэйри, которые, согласно эльфийской мифологии, 
предшествуют всем "детям Илуватара" и являются изначальными, часто не связанными 
специально ни с Валар, ни с Морготом, но имманентно присущими Арде как ее 
необходимая часть "духами природы" (сf. Йарвен во "Властелине", в котором можно 
с наибольшей вероятностью видеть крупнейшего представителя этой категории 
существ - "Хозяина мира", воплощенного духа-всей-Арды-в-целом, причем, как было 
остроумно предположено недавно, Арды в ее изначальном, "неискаженном" 
состоянии). Как видно из того, что люди могли смешивать этих фэйри с эльфами в 
одну категорию "народа тени" или включать их в число эльфов как таковых (ср. 
ниже применение термина Shadow Folk одинаково к тем и другим обитателям Хисиломе 
и вообще отождествление людьми множества ардианских духов с эльфами), внешне от 
эльфов они ничем не отличались, что позволяет гипотетически выводить из их среды 
и эльфов, и особенно другие сходные расы, включая орков. Cf. also Fr.2, 4, 4a, 
15; Fr.58, l.2132; Fr.112, 132 on bogeys, 228a-d; cf. одинаковое эльфийское 
наименование орков и балрогов *"рауко" с общим значением "демон" (аналогичнo 
"гоблину", как называли и орков, и прочую нечисть, и нолдор)! Поскольку, по 
наиболее архаическим и наименее тенденциозным изводам эльфийской мифологии, орки 
появились еще до "Пробуждения" эльфов и людей, и при этом отличаются всеми 
источниками от животных, этих исходных орков остается либо выводить из общности 
указанных исходных "фэйри" (естественнонаучный выбор), либо считать 
псевдожизнью, кремниевыми биороботами, созданными Мелькором (одна из 
теологических версий, представленная мифом о творении орков Мелькором из 
камня).<BR>Подробнее о фэйри и о происхождении орков от одной из их категорий

little of light or loveliness or of musics save it be dark songs and chantings 
of a rugged wonder that faded in the wooded places or echoed in deep caves.

when all these had crossed the confines of the world and Vilna was in uproar 
with their passing, there came still hurrying late Makar and his fierce sister 
Measse; and it had been better had they not found the world but remained for 
ever with the Ainur beyond Vaitya and the stars, for both were spirits of 
quarrelsome mood, and with some other lesser ones who came now with them had 
been the first and chief to join in the discords of Melko and to aid in the 
spreading of his music. /../ <BR>/Three Skies' levels/ three airs. Vaitya is 
that which is wrapped dark and sluggish about the world and without it, but Ilwe 
is blue and clear and flows among the stars, and last came they to Vilna that is 
grey and therein may the birds fly safely.With them came many of those lesser 
Vali who loved them and had played nigh them and attuned their music to theirs, 
and these are the Manir and the Suruli, the sylphs of the airs and of the 
winds.<BR>/Coming of Aule and Yavanna to Middle-Earth before the Construction of 
the Lamps/ ...but with Aule was that great lady Palurien whose delights were 
richness and fruits of the earth, for which reason has she long been called 
Yavanna among the Eldar.About them fared a great host who are the sprites of 
trees and woods, of dale and forest and mountain-side, or those- that sing amid 
the grass at morning and chant among the standing corn at eve. These are the 
Nermir and the Tavari, Nandini and Orossi, brownies, fays, pixies, leprawns, and 
what else are they not called, for their number is very great: yet must they not 
be confused with the Eldar, for they were born before the world and are older 
than its oldest, and are not of it, but laugh at it much, for had they not 
somewhat to do with its making, so that it is for the most part a play for them; 
but the Eldar are of the world and love it with a great and burning love, and 
are wistful in all their happiness for that reason.<BR>/Comm./ Particularly 
interesting is the passage concerning the host of lesser spirits who accompanied 
Aule and Palurien, from which one sees how old is the conception of the Eldar as 
quite dissimilar in essential nature from 'brownies, fays, pixies, leprawns', 
since the Eldar are 'of the world' and bound to it, whereas those others are 
beings from before the world's making. In the later work there is no trace of 
any such explanation of the 'pixie' element in the world's population: the Maiar 
are little referred to, and certainly not said to include such beings as 'sing 
amid the grass at morning and chant among the standing corn at eve'.*<BR>* Cf. 
The Silmarillion p. 30: 'With the Valar came other spirits whose being also 
began before the world, of the same order as the Valar but of less degree. These 
are the Maiar, the people of the Valar, and their servants and helpers. Their 
number is not known to the Elves, and few have names in any of the tongues of 
the Children of Iluvatar.' An earlier version of this passage reads: 'Many 
lesser spirits they [the Valar] brought in their train, both great and small, 
and some of these Men have confused with the Eldar or Elves; but wrongly, for 
they were before the world, but Elves and Men awoke first in the world after the 
coming of the Valar.'<BR>j. BLT 1 (HME 1)/4. The chaining of Melko.<BR>That 
night Eriol heard again in his sleep the music that had so moved him on the 
first night; and the next morning he went again into the gardens early. There he 
met Vaire, and she called him Eriol: 'that was the first making and uttering of 
that name'. Eriol told Vaire of the 'dream-musics' he had heard, and she said 
that it was no dream-music, but rather the flute of Timpinen, 'whom those Gnomes 
Rumil and Little- heart and others of my house call Tinfang'. She told him that 
the children called him Tinfang Warble; and that he played and danced in summer 
dusks for joy of the first stars: 'at every note a new one sparkles forth and 
glisters. The Noldoli say that they come out too soon if Tinfang Warble plays, 
and they love him, and the children will watch often from the windows lest he 
tread the shadowy lawns unseen.' She told Eriol that he was 'shier than a fawn 
-- swift to hide and dart away as any vole: a footstep on a twig and he is away, 
and his fluting will come mocking from afar'. 'And a marvel of wizardry liveth 
in that fluting,' said Eriol, 'if that it be indeed which I have heard now for 
two nights here. 'There be none,' said Vaire, 'not even of the Solosimpi, who 
can rival him therein, albeit those same pipers claim him as their kin; yet 'tis 
said everywhere that this quaint spirit is neither wholly of the Valar nor of 
the Eldar, but is half a fay of the woods and dells, one of the great companies 
of the children of Palurien, and half a Gnome or a Shoreland Piper.' Howso that 
be he is a wondrous wise and strange creature, and he fared hither away with the 
Eldar long ago, marching nor resting among them but going always ahead piping 
strangely or whiles sitting aloof. Now does he play about the gardens of the 
land; but Alalminore he loves the best, and this garden best of all. Ever and 
again we miss his piping for long months, and we say: "Tinfang Warble has gone 
heart-breaking in the Great Lands, and many a one in those far regions will hear 
his piping in the dusk outside tonight." <BR>/Comm./ In the earliest version 
Tinfang is called a 'leprawn', and in the early glossary of the Gnomish speech 
he is a 'fay'. <BR>k. BLT 1 (HME 1)/4. The chaining of Melko.<BR>/After Lamps'

Orome less gloomy and Palurien was comforted, seeing the beauty of the first 
stars of Varda /.../ At that time did many strange spirits fare into the world, 
for there were pleasant places dark and quiet for them to dwell in. Some came 
from Mandos, aged spirits that journeyed from Iluvatar with him who are older 
than the world and very gloomy and secret, and some from the fortresses of the 
North where Melko then dwelt in the deep dungeons of Utumna. Full of evil and 
unwholesome were they; luring and restlessness and horror they brought, turning 
the dark into an ill and fearful thing, which it was not before. But some few 
danced thither with gentle feet exuding evening scents, and these came from the 
gardens of Lorien. Still is the world full of these in the days of light, 
lingering alone in shadowy hearts of primeval forests, calling secret things 
across a starry waste, and haunting caverns in the hills that few have found: --

Earliest Annals of Valinor /AV 1/. Comm. to engl.translation.<BR>This is not a 
version, but a single page of manuscript with first, a different beginning to 
the Annals of Valinor in Modern English, and then ten lines, written very 
rapidly, in Old English. Both contain interesting features. The first reads as 
follows: In what is said here concerning the lesser spirits of Valarin race 
there are differences from AV (/HME 4/ p. 311) and the Old English version II 
(/HME 4/ p. 340). In this present fragment these spirits are not called 
Valarindi but Vanimor, 'the Fair'. The Children of the Valar, 'who were many and 
very beautiful', are counted among the Vanimor, but, in contradiction to AV, 
they were "on worolde acende", 'born in the world'. At this time, it seems, my 
father was tending to emphasize the generative powers of the great Valar, though 
afterwards all trace of the conception disappeared.<BR>r. LsR (HME5)/2:2. The 
Later Annals of Valinor /AV 2/<BR>/beginning section/ <BR>With these great ones 
/Valar/ came many lesser spirits, beings of their own kind but of smaller might; 
these are the Vanimor, the Beautiful. And with them also were later numbered 
their children, begotten in the world, but of divine race, who were many and 
fair; these are the Valarindi. <BR>/Comm. to beginning section/. This is 
associated with development in the idea of the lesser beings who came into the 
world with the Valar, which underwent several changes (ultimately emerging into 
the conception of the Maiar). In Q (/HME/ IV. 78) these spirits are mentioned 
but not given any name, and the same remains the case in QS (§2). In AV 1 (/HME/ 
IV. 263) a distinction is made between the children of the Valar on the one hand 
and 'beings of their own kind but of less might' on the other; but all entered 
the world with the Valar, and all are called Valarindi. In AV 2 the distinction 
is enlarged: the lesser spirits, 'beings of their own kind but of smaller 
might', who came with the Valar, are the Vanimor, 'the Beautiful', and the 
Children of the Valar, who did not enter the world with them but were begotten 
in the world, are the Valarindi; these were 'later numbered with' the Vanimor. 
In the Old English fragment referred to above the same is said, though the name 
Valarindi is not there given to the Children of the Valar (/HME/ IV. 293). 
<BR>s. LsR (HME5)/2:6. Quenta Silmarillion /QS/. <BR>/...Eru/ showed the World 
to the Ainur. And many of the mightiest of them became enamoured of its beauty, 
and desired to enter into it; and they put on the raiment of the World, and 
descended into it, and they are in it. . These spirits the Elves name the Valar, 
which is the Powers, and Men have often called them Gods. Many lesser spirits of 
their own kind they brought in their train, both great and small; and some of 
these Men have confused with the Elves, but wrongly, for they were made before 
the World, whereas Elves and Men awoke first in the World, after the coming of 
the Valar. Yet in the making of Elves and of Men, and in the giving to each of 
their especial gifts, none of the Valar had any part. Iluvatar alone was their 
author; wherefore they are called the Children of Iluvatar.<BR>t. LsR (HME5)/3.

turned westward, where was the land of Aman, as they believed, and an abiding 
peace. And it is said that of old there was a fair folk dwelling yet in 
Middle-earth, and Men knew not whence they came. But some said that they were 
the children of the Avaloi /Valar, Gods/ and did not die, for their home was in

again was grass so green, nor flower so fair, nor water so filled with light 
when they had gone. And the Eruhin for the most part followed them, though some 
there were that remained in the Great Lands, free men, serving no evil lord; and 
they were shepherds and dwelt far from the towers and cities of the kings. But 
those of the Eruhin who were mightiest and most fair, closest in friendship with 
the Nimri, most beloved by the Servants of God, turned their faces to the light 
of the West /.../ And at the end of journeys beyond memory they came at last to 
the shores of the Great Seas. There they halted and were filled with great 
dread, and with longing; for the Nimri passed ever over the waters, seeking the 
land of Aman, and the Eruhin could not follow them. Then such of the Nimri as 
remained in the west of the world took pity on the Eruhin, and instructed them 
in many arts.<BR>/Comm. to §5/. In §16 the Nimri are called, without any 
qualification of 'some said', 'the children of the Deathless Folk'. Cf. the 
opening of the Quenta Silmarillion (/HME/ V.204, §2): "These spirits the Elves 
name the Valar, which is the Powers, and Men have often called them Gods. Many 
lesser spirits of their own kind they brought in their train, both great and 
small; and some of these Men have confused with the Elves, but wrongly, for they 
were made before the World, whereas Elves and Men awoke first in the World, 
after the coming of the Valar". Though not mentioned in this passage, the 
conception of 'the Children of the Valar' is frequently encountered in the 
Quenta Silmarillion; and cf. especially The Later Annals of Valinor (V.110): 
'With these great ones came many lesser spirits, beings of their own kind but of 
smaller might... And with them also were later numbered their children...' /.../

for they were made before the World, whereas Elves and Men awoke first on Earth,

Действительно, продолжение этой речи (со стк.2143) заведомо принадлежит Тху. 
Однако искреннее вожделение, проявляемое в цитированном отрывке по отношению к 
Лэтиэн (совершенно немыслимое для майа, а равно, хотя и по другим причинам, для 
веревольфов), которое говорящий не только высказывает от своего лица, но даже 
предполагает за вала Мелькором (!), в сочетании с переходом от 2-го лица по 
отношению к "Неребу" в стк. 2117 -2136 к 3-му в стк. 2137-2142 ("Нереб выглядит 
разъяренным /при словах о Лэтиэн/ ... что беспокоит его?" и т.д.) и затем опять 
ко 2-му в отрывке стк.2143 слл. ("Кому вы служите, Свету или Мраку?" и т.д.), а 
также с резким перепадом речи в этом отрывке (стк.2143 слл.) по сравнению с 
предыдущим (стк.2117-2136) от примитивно-солдатской к высокой и эмфатизированной

существенно более низкого статуса, то есть, вернее всего, служащие при нем орки 
же; затем, в стк.2137-2142 передаются мысли, посетившие Тху при этом допросе, и 
только со стк.2143 - его собственные слова, начиная с того момента, как он, под 
воздействием этих мыслей, вступил в разговор сам (чем и объясняется как перепад

the beginning of Annals/ <BR>There is here the remarkable statement that Morgoth 
'devises the Balrogs and the Orcs', implying that it was only now that they came 
into being. In Q (§2) /= Fr.76/, following S /= Fr.68/, they originated (if the 
Balrogs were not already in existence) in the ancient darkness after the 
overthrow of the Lamps, and when Morgoth returned to Angband 'countless became 
the number of the hosts of his Orcs and demons' (§4) /= Fr.77/; similarly in AV 
1/= Fr.89/ he 'bred and gathered once more his evil servants, Orcs and Balrogs'. 
A note written against the passage in Q § 4 /= Fr.77, note 8/ directs, however, 
that the making of the Orcs should be brought in here rather than earlier: and 
in the version of 'The Silmarillion' that followed Q (later than these Annals) 
this was in fact done: "when Morgoth returned, countless became the hosts of his 
beasts and demons; and he brought into being the race of the Orcs, and they grew 
and multiplied in the bowels of the earth". (The subsequent elaboration of the 
origin of the Orcs is extremely complex and cannot be entered into here.) It is 
clear, therefore, that these words in AB 1, despite the fact of its being 
evidently earlier than AV 1, look forward to the later idea (itself impermanent) 
that the Orcs were not made until after Morgoth's return from

never far estranged, there came thus also to be differences in speech among the 
Noldor themselves, and the kinds are accounted five: the speech of Mithrim and 
of Fingolfin'sfolk; and the speech of Gondolin and the people of Turgon; the 
speech of Nargothrond and the house and folk of Felagund and his brothers; and 
the speech of Himring and the sons of Feanor; and the corrupted speech of the 
thrall-Gnomes, spoken by the Noldor that were held captive in Angband, or 
compelled to the service of Morgoth and the Orcs. /NB. Note that the Orcs are

himself spoke all tongues with power and beauty, when so he wished.<BR>/Comm. on

sundry times and places in the most ancient days, and taught them such things as 
they knew. But other Men learned also wholly or in part of the Orcs and of the 
Dwarves; while in the West ere they came into Beleriand the fair houses of the 
eldest Men learned of the Danas, or Green-elves.<BR>d. Lhammas A /quoted in 
Comm. on Lhammas B, § 10/<BR>In Lhammas A the origin and early history of the 
tongues of Men is somewhat differently described: 'For the Dark-elves... 
befriended wandering Men... and taught them such as they knew; and in the 
passing of the years the manifold tongues of Men developed from these 
beginnings, altered by time, and the invention of Men, and owning also the 
influence both of Dwarves and Orcs /.../'<BR>e. Trees of Tongues /Rend. in Comm. 
on Lhammas B, § 10/ <BR>In the earlier Tree of Tongues the languages of Men are 
derived solely from Lemberin, agreeing with Lhammas A ('the manifold tongues of 
Men developed from these beginnings'), whereas the later Tree shows 'influence' 
(dotted lines) from Dwarf-speech, from Orc-speech, and from Lemberin (but no 
direct 'descent') /.../.<BR>
