<BR>PM (HME12)/1:7. The Heirs of Elendil.  
<BR>10. 
Denethor I. born 2375 lived 102 years died 2477. Great troubles arose in his 
day. The  Morgul-lords having bred in secret a fell race of black Orcs in 
Mordor assail Ithilien and overrun it.

<BR>PM (HME12)/1:9. The Making of Appendix A. (iii) The House of Eorl.   <BR>The death 
of Eomund chief Marshal of the Mark in an Orc-raid in 3002 is recorded, with the 
note  that 'Orcs at this time began often to raid eastern Rohan and steal 
horses',

<BR>PM (HME12)/1:9. The Making of Appendix A. (iv) 
Durin's Folk.
<BR>The passage added to the first version was slightly filled 
out and improved, but the only difference worth noticing here lies in the 
sentences following the words 'made war on the Orcs of the Misty Mountains 
in revenge for Thror', which now read: 'Long and deadly was that war, and it 
 was fought for the most part in dark places beneath the earth; and at the 
last the Dwarves had the  victory, and in the Battle before the Gate of 
Moria ten thousand Orcs were slain. But the Dwarves suffered also grievous 
loss and his folk were now so diminished that Thrain dared not to enter 
 Moria, and his people were dispersed again.' 
<BR>Little indeed is known of 
what happened to him afterwards. It would seem (from afterknowledge) that 
no sooner was he abroad with few companions (and certainly after he came at 
length back into  Rhovanion) he was hunted by the emissaries of Sauron. 
Wolves pursued him, orcs waylaid him, evil birds shadowed his path, and the 
more he tried to go north the more he was driven back. 
<A NAME="fr204"></A><P align=justify><b>Fr.204.</b> 
<BR>PM (HME12)/2:10. Of Dwarves and Men I /Dwarwes/. <BR>They /Dvarves 
Longbeards/ regarded the Iron Hills, the Ered Mithrin, and the east dales of the 
 Misty Mountains as their own land. But they were under attack from the Orks 
of Morgoth. During the  War of the Jewels and the Siege of Angband, when 
Morgoth needed all his strength, these attacks ceased; but when Morgoth 
fell and Angband was destroyed hosts of the Orks fled eastwards seeking 
 homes. They were now masterless and without any general leadership, but 
they were well-armed and very numerous, cruel, savage, and reckless in 
assault. In the battles that followed the Dwarves were outnumbered, and 
though they were the most redoubtable warriors of all the Speaking Peoples 
 they were glad to make alliance with Men. /.../   
<BR>At the same time, 
however, /First Half of S.A./ Sauron came out of hiding and revealed himself in 
 fair form. For long he paid little heed to Dwarves or Men and endeavoured 
to win the friendship and trust of the Eldar. But slowly he reverted again 
to the allegiance of Morgoth and began to seek power by force, marshalling 
again and directing the Orks and other evil things of the First Age, and 
secretly building his great fortress in the mountain-girt land in the South that 
was afterwards known as Mordor. /.../   
<BR>/after 1700 S.A./ For though 
Moria remained impregnable for many centuries, the Orks reinforced and 
commanded by servants of Sauron invaded the mountains again. Gundabad was 
re-taken, the Ered Mithrin infested and the communication between Moria and 
the Iron Hills for a time cut off. The Men of the Alliance were involved in 
war not only with Orks but with alien Men of evil sort. For Sauron had 
acquired dominion over many savage tribes in the East (of old corrupted by 
Morgoth), and he now urged them to seek land and booty in the West.

Languages.   
<BR>/The Folk of Haleth/ were and remained to their end a small 
people, chiefly concerned to protect their own woodlands, and they excelled 
in forest warfare. Indeed for long even those Orks specially trained for 
this dared not set foot near their borders.

<BR>PM (HME12)/2:10. Of Dwarves and Men. Note 25. 
<BR>[In the rejected conclusion of 
note 21 the place of the awakening of the ancestor of the Longbeards was 'a 
valley in the Ered Mithrin' (the Grey Mountains in the far North). There has of 
course been no previous reference to this ancient significance of Mount 
Gundabad. That mountain originally appeared in the chapter The Clouds Burst 
in The Hobbit, where it is told that the Goblins 'marched and gathered by 
hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, until around and 
beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a 
vast host was assembled'; and it is shown on the map of Wilderland in The 
Hobbit as a great isolated mass at the northern end of the Misty Mountains 
where the Grey Mountains drew towards them. In The Lord of the Rings, 
Appendix A (III), Gundabad appears in the account of the War of the Dwarves and 
Orcs late in the Third Age, where the Dwarves 'assailed and sacked one by 
one all the strongholds of the Orcs that they could  from Gundabad to the 
Gladden' (the word 'find' was erroneously dropped in the Second Edition).]

<BR>PM (HME12)/2:10. Of Dwarves and Men. Note 51. 
<BR>/Note common and specific habit of Orcs and Druedain to eat funguses, 
cf.tradition on their common origin/. Apart from some slight and largely 
unnecessary modifications to the original text (in no case altering the 
sense) there are a few points to mention about that printed in Unfinished Tales. 
<BR>(1) The spelling Ork(s) was changed to Orc(s), and that of the river 
Taiglin to Teiglin (see XI.228, 309-10). (2) A passage about the liking of 
the Drugs /Druedain/ for edible fungus was omitted in view of my father's 
pencilled note beside it: 'Delete all this about funguses. Too like 
Hobbits' (a reference of course to Frodo and Farmer Maggot's mushrooms). 
This followed the account of the knowledge of the Drugs concerning plants, 
and reads: To the astonishment of Elves and other Men they ate funguses 
with pleasure, many of which looked to others ugly and dangerous; some kinds 
which they specially liked they caused to grow near their dwellings. The 
Eldar did not eat these things. The Folk of Haleth, taught by the Druedain, 
made some use of them at need; and if they were guests they ate what was 
provided in courtesy, and without fear. The other Atani eschewed them, save 
in great hunger when astray in the wild, for few among them had the knowledge to 
distinguish the wholesome from the bad, and the less wise called them 
ork-plants and supposed them to have been cursed and blighted by Morgoth.

<BR>PM (HME12)/2:10. The Shibboleth of Feanor. 
<BR>The lore of the Eldar did not depend on perishable records, being stored in the vast 
houses of their minds.(23)   
<BR>Note 23. Nor were the 'loremasters' a 
separate guild of gentle scribes, soon burned by the Orks of Angband upon 
pyres of books. They were mostly even as Feanor, the greatest, kings, princes 
and warriors, such as the valiant captains of Gondolin, or Finrod of 
Nargothrond and Rodothir [&gt; Arothir] his kinsman and steward.

<A NAME="fr209a"></A><BR><B>a.</B> PM (HME12)/4:16. The New Shadow.   
<BR>Such as the 
evidence is, then, the original work (represented by the manuscript A and the 
typescript B) derives from the 1950s. In a letter of 13 May 1964 (Letters 
no.256) he wrote: I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the 
Downfall [of Sauron], but it proved both sinister and depressing. Since we 
are dealing with Men it is inevitable that we should be concerned with the 
most regrettable feature of their nature: their quick satiety with good. So 
that the people of Gondor in times of peace, justice and prosperity, would 
become discontented and restless - while the dynasts descended from Aragorn 
would become just kings and governors - like Denethor or worse. I found 
that even so early there was an outcrop of revolutionary plots, about a centre 
of secret Satanistic religion; while Gondorian boys were playing at being 
Orcs and going round doing damage. I could have written a 'thriller' about 
the plot and its discovery and overthrow - but it would be just that. Not 
worth doing. From the evidence given above, however, it is seen that his 
interest in the story was subsequently reawakened, and even reached the 
point of making a new (though  incomplete) version of what he had written of 
it years before. But in 1972, fifteen months before his death, he wrote to 
his friend Douglas Carter (Letters no.338): I have written nothing beyond 
the first few years of the Fourth Age. (Except the beginning of a tale 
supposed to refer to the end of the reign of Eldarion about 100 years after 
the death of Aragorn. Then I of course discovered that the King's Peace 
would contain no tales worth recounting; and his wars would have little 
interest after the overthrow of Sauron; but that almost certainly a 
restlessness would appear about then, owing to the (it seems) inevitable 
boredom of Men with the good: there would be secret societies practising 
dark cults, and 'orc-cults' among adolescents.)   
<BR>THE NEW SHADOW.   
<BR>This tale begins in the days of Eldarion, son of that Elessar of whom the 
histories have much to tell. One hundred and five years had passed since 
the fall of the Dark Tower, and the story of that time was little heeded 
now by most of the people of Gondor, though a few were still living who 
could remember the War of the Ring as a shadow upon their early childhood. 
One of these was old Borlas of Pen-arduin. He was the younger son of 
Beregond, the first Captain of the Guard of Prince Faramir, who had removed 
with his lord from the City to the Emyn Arnen.   
<BR>/.../ 'Deep indeed run the 
roots of Evil,' said Borlas, 'and the black sap is strong in them. That 
tree will never be slain. Let men hew it as often as they may, it will 
thrust up shoots again as soon as they turn aside. Not even at the Feast of 
Felling should the axe be hung up on the wall! '   
<BR>'Plainly you think you 
are speaking wise words,' said Saelon. 'I guess that by the gloom in your 
voice, and by the nodding of your head. But what is this all about? Your 
life seems fair enough still, for an aged man that does not now go far 
abroad. Where have you found a shoot of your dark tree growing? In your own 
garden?'   
<BR>Borlas looked up, and as he glanced keenly at Saelon he wondered 
suddenly if this young man, usually gay and often half mocking, had more in 
his mind than appeared in his face. 
<BR>Borlas had not intended to open his 
heart to him, but being burdened in thought he had spoken aloud, more to 
himself than his companion. Saelon did not return his glance. He was humming 
softly, while he trimmed a whistle of green willow with a sharp nail-knife. 
<BR>The two were sitting in an arbour near the steep eastern shore of Anduin 
where it flowed about the feet of the hills of Arnen. They were indeed in 
Borlas's garden and his small grey-stone house could be seen through the 
trees above them on the hill-slope facing west. Borlas looked at the river, 
and at the trees in their June leaves, and then far off to the towers of the 
City under the glow of late afternoon. 'No, not in my garden,' he said 
thoughtfully.
<BR>'Then why are you so troubled?' asked Saelon. 'If a man has 
a fair garden with strong walls, then he has as much as any man can govern 
for his own pleasure.' He paused. 'As long as he keeps the strength of life 
in him,' he added. 'When that fails, why trouble about any lesser ill? For then 
he must soon leave his garden at last, and others must look to the weeds.' 
<BR>Borlas sighed, but he did not answer, and Saelon went on: 'But there are 
of course some who will not be content, and to their life's end they 
trouble their hearts about their neighbours, and the City, and the Realm, 
and all the wide world. You are one of them, Master Borlas, and have ever been 
so, since I first knew you as a boy that you caught in your orchard. Even 
then you were not content to let ill alone: to deter me with a beating, or 
to strengthen your fences. No. You were grieved and wanted to improve me. 
You had me into your house and talked to me. 'I remember it well. "Orcs' 
work," you said many times. "Stealing good fruit, well, I suppose that is 
no worse than boys' work, if they are hungry, or their fathers are too 
easy. But pulling down unripe apples to break or cast away! That is Orcs' 
work. How did you come to do such a thing, lad?"
<BR>'Orcs' work! I was 
angered by that, Master Borlas, and too proud to answer, though it was in my 
heart to say in child's words: "If it was wrong for a boy to steal an apple 
to eat, then it is wrong to steal one to play with. But not more wrong. 
Don't speak to me of Orcs' work, or I may show you some!"
<BR>'It was a 
mistake, Master Borlas. For I had heard tales of the Orcs and their doings, but 
I had not been interested till then. You turned my mind to them. I grew out 
of petty thefts (my father was not too easy), but I did not forget the 
Orcs. I began to feel hatred and think of the sweetness of revenge. We 
played at Orcs, I and my friends, and sometimes I thought: "Shall I gather my 
band and go and cut down his trees? Then he will think that the Orcs have 
really returned." But that was a long time ago,' Saelon ended with a smile. 
<BR>Borlas was startled. He was now receiving confidences, not giving them. 
And there was something disquieting in the young man's tone, something that 
made him wonder whether deep down, as deep as the roots of the dark trees, 
the childish resentment did not still linger. Yes, even in the heart of 
Saelon, the friend of his own son, and the young man who had in the last few 
years shown him much kindness in his loneliness. At any rate he resolved to 
say no more of his own thoughts to him.
<BR>'Alas!' he said, 'we all make 
mistakes. I do not claim wisdom, young man, except maybe the little that 
one may glean with the passing of the years. From which I know well enough the 
sad truth that those who mean well may do more harm than those who let 
things be. I am sorry now for what I said, if it roused hate in your heart. 
Though I still think that it was just: untimely maybe, and yet true. Surely 
even a boy must understand that fruit is fruit, and does not reach its full 
being until it is ripe; so that to misuse it unripe is to do worse than 
just to rob the man that has tended it: it robs the world, hinders a good 
thing from fulfilment. Those who do so join forces with all that is amiss, 
with the blights and the cankers and the ill winds. And that was the way of 
Orcs.'
<BR>'And is the way of Men too,' said Saelon. 'No! I do not mean 
of wild men only, or those who grew "under the Shadow", as they say. I mean 
all Men. I would not misuse green fruit now, but only because I have no 
longer any use for unripe apples, not for your lofty reasons, Master Borlas. 
Indeed I think your reasons as unsound as an apple that has been too long 
in store. To trees all Men are Orcs. Do Men consider the fulfilment of the 
life-story of a tree before they cut it down? For whatever purpose: to have 
its room for tilth, to use its flesh as timber or as fuel, or merely to 
open the view? If trees were the judges, would they set Men above Orcs, or 
indeed above the cankers and blights? What more right, they might ask, have 
Men to feed on their juices than blights?'
<BR>'A man,' said Borlas, 
'who tends a tree and guards it from blights and many other enemies does not 
act like an Orc or a canker. If he eats its fruit, he does it no injury. It 
produces fruit more abundantly than it needs for its own purpose: the 
continuing of its kind.' 'Let him eat the fruit then, or play with it,' 
said Saelon. 'But I spoke of slaying: hewing and burning; and by what right 
men do such things to trees.'
<BR>'You did not. You spoke of the judgement 
of trees in these matters. But trees are not judges. The children of the 
One are the masters. My judgement as one of them you know already. The evils of 
the world were not at first in the great Theme, but entered with the 
discords of Melkor. Men did not come with these discords; they entered 
afterwards as a new thing direct from Eru, the One, and therefore they are 
called His children, and all that was in the Theme they have, for their own 
good, the right to use - rightly, without pride or wantonness, but with 
reverence.(10)
<BR>'If the smallest child of a woodman feels the cold of 
winter, the proudest tree is not wronged, if it is bidden to surrender its 
flesh to warm the child with fire. But the child must not mar the tree in 
play or spite, rip its bark or break its branches. And the good husbandman will 
use first, if he can, dead wood or an old tree; he will not fell a young 
tree and leave it to rot, for no better reason than his pleasure in 
axe-play. That is orkish.   'But it is even as I said: the roots of Evil 
lie deep, and from far off comes the poison that works in us, so that many 
do these things - at times, and become then indeed like the servants of 
Melkor. But the Orcs did these things at all times; they did harm with 
delight to all things that could suffer it, and they were restrained only 
by lack of power, not by either prudence or mercy. But we have spoken 
enough of this.'
<BR>'Why!' said Saelon. 'We have hardly begun. It was not of 
your orchard, nor your apples, nor of me, that you were thinking when you 
spoke of the re-arising of the dark tree. What you were thinking of, Master 
Borlas, I can guess nonetheless. I have eyes and ears, and other senses, 
Master.' His voice sank low and could scarcely be heard above the murmur of 
a sudden chill wind in the leaves, as the sun sank behind Mindolluin. 'You 
have heard then the name?' With hardly more than breath he formed it. 'Of 
Herumor?'
<BR>Borlas looked at him with amazement and fear. His mouth made 
tremulous motions of speech, but no sound came from it.
<BR>'I see that 
you have,' said Saelon. 'And you seem astonished to learn that I have heard it 
also. But you are not more astonished than I was to see that this name 
has reached you. For, as I say, I have keen eyes and ears, but yours are 
now dim even for daily use, and the matter has been kept as secret as 
cunning could contrive.'
<BR>'Whose cunning?' said Borlas, suddenly and 
fiercely. The sight of his eyes might be dim, but they blazed now with 
anger.   
<BR>'Why, those who have heard the call of the name, of course,' 
answered Saelon unperturbed. 'They are not many yet, to set against all the 
people of Gondor, but the number is growing. Not all are content since the 
Great King died, and fewer now are afraid.'
<BR>'So I have guessed,' said 
Borlas, 'and it is that thought that chills the warmth of summer in my 
heart. For a man may have a garden with strong walls, Saelon, and yet find 
no peace or content there. There are some enemies that such walls will 
not keep out; for his garden is only part of a guarded realm after all. It 
is to the walls of the realm that he must look for his real defence. But 
what is the call? What would they do?' he cried, laying his hand on the young 
man's knee.
<BR>'I will ask you a question first before I answer yours,' said 
Saelon; and now he looked searchingly at the old man. 'How have you, who 
sit here in the Emyn Arnen and seldom go now even to the City - how have 
you heard the whispers of this name?'
<BR>Borlas looked down on the ground 
and clasped his hands between his knees. For some time he did not answer. 
At last he looked up again; his face had hardened and his eyes were more wary. 
'I will not answer that, Saelon,' he said. 'Not until I have asked you yet 
another question. First tell me,' he said slowly, 'are you one of those who 
have listened to the call?'
<BR>A strange smile flickered about the young 
man's mouth. 'Attack is the best defence,' he answered, 'or so the s tell 
us; but when both sides use this counsel there is a clash of battle. So I will 
counter you. I will not answer you, Master Borlas, until you tell me: are 
you one of those who have listened, or no?'
<BR>'How can you think it?' cried Borlas.
<BR>'And how can you think it?' asked Saelon.
<BR>'As for me,' said Borlas, 'do not all my words give you the answer?'
<BR>'But as for me, you would say,' said Saelon, 'my words might make me doubtful? Because I 
defended a small boy who threw unripe apples at his playmates from the name 
of Orc? Or because I spoke of the suffering of trees at the hands of men? 
Master Borlas, it is unwise to judge a man's heart from words spoken in an 
argument without respect for your opinions. They may be meant to disturb you. 
Pert maybe, but possibly better than a mere echo. I do not doubt that many 
of those we spoke of would use words as solemn as yours, and speak 
reverently of the Great Theme and such things - in your presence. Well, who 
shall answer first?'
<BR>'The younger it would have been in the courtesy of old,' said Borlas; 'or between men counted as equals, the one who was first 
asked. You are both.'
<BR>Saelon smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'Let me see: the first question that you asked unanswered was: what is the call, what 
would they do? Can you find no answer in the past for all your age and 
lore? I am young and less learned. Still, if you really wish to know, I 
could perhaps make the whispers clearer to you.'
<BR>/.../ 
<BR>Note 10. 
This passage in the argument was expressed rather differently in B (which was 
following A almost exactly):
<BR>'A man,' said Borlas, 'who tends a tree 
and guards it from blights, and eats its fruit - which it produces more 
abundantly than its mere life-need; not that eating the fruit need destroy the 
seed - does not act like a canker, nor like an Orc.
<BR>'But as for the 
cankers, I wonder. They live, it might be said, and yet their life is death. I 
do not believe that they were part of the Music of the Ainur, unless in the 
discords of Melkor. And so with Orcs.'
<BR>'And what of Men?' said Arthael.
<BR>'Why do you ask?' said Borlas. 'You know, surely, what is 
taught? They were not at first in the Great Music, but they did not enter 
with the discords of Melkor: they came from Iluvatar himself, and therefore 
they are called the Children of God. And all that is in the Music they have a 
right to use - rightly: which is with reverence, not with pride or 
wantonness.'
<A NAME="fr209b"></A><BR><BR><B>b.</B> Letters. Letter 183.
<BR>In my story I do not deal in 
Absolute Evil. I do not think there is such a thing, since that is Zero. I 
do not think that at any rate any 'rational being' is wholly evil. Satan fell. 
In my myth Morgoth fell before Creation of the physical world. In my story 
Sauron represents as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is 
possible. He had gone the way of all tyrants: beginning well, at least on 
the level that while desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he 
still at first considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of 
the Earth. But he went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for 
domination, being in origin an immortal (angelic) spirit. In The Lord of 
the Rings the conflict is not basically about 'freedom', though that is 
naturally involved. It is about God, and His sole right to divine honour. The 
Eldar and the Numenoreans believed in The One, the true God, and held 
worship of any other person an abomination.
<BR>Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants; if he had been victorious 
he would have demanded divine honour from all rational creatures and 
absolute temporal power over the whole world. So even if in desperation 
'the West' had bred or hired hordes of orcs and had cruelly ravaged the 
lands of other Men as allies of Sauron, or merely to prevent them from aiding 
him, their Cause would have remained indefeasibly right. As does the Cause 
of those who oppose now the State-God and Marshal This or That as its High 
Priest, even if it is true (as it unfortunately is) that many of their 
deeds are wrong, even if it were true (as it is not) that the inhabitants of 
'The West', except for a minority of wealthy bosses, live in fear and 
squalor, while the worshippers of the State-God live in peace and abundance 
and in mutual esteem and trust. So I feel that the fiddle-faddle in 
reviews, and correspondence about them, as to whether my 'good people' were

Rohirrim, Men of Dale or of Gondor, any better than men have been or are,

fleeing into the gathering night. A company of Orcs was encamped in the 
midst of the road, huddled about a large wood-fire.

been made a nobler people; and he says that the Men that have lately come

<BR>UT/1:2. Narn I Hin Hurin. Turin among the Outlaws 
<BR>Some fifty of these 
Men had joined in one band, wandering in the woods beyond the western marches 
of Doriath; and they were hated scarcely less than Orcs, for there were 
among them outcasts hard of heart, bearing a grudge against their own kind. 
/.../ 
<BR>Not long afterwards, as Beleg had feared, the Orcs came across the 
Brithiach, and being resisted with all the force that he could muster by 
Handir of Brethil they passed south over the Crossings of Teiglin in search 
of plunder. Many of the Woodmen had taken Beleg's counsel and sent their women 
and children to ask for refuge in Brethil. These and their escort escaped, 
passing over the Crossings in time; but the armed men that came behind 
were met by the Orcs, and the men were worsted. A few fought their way 
through and came to Brethil, but many were slain or captured; and the Orcs 
passed on to the homesteads, and sacked them and burned them. Then at once they 
turned back westwards, seeking the Road, for they wished now to return 
North as swiftly as they could with their booty and their captives. 
<BR>But the scouts of the outlaws were soon aware of them; and though they 
cared little enough for the captives, the plunder of the Woodmen aroused 
their greed. To Turin it seemed perilous to reveal themselves to the Orcs, 
until their numbers were known; but the outlaws would not heed him, for 
they had need of many things in the wild, and already some began to regret 
his leading. Therefore taking one Orleg as his only companion Turin went 
forth to spy upon the Orcs; and giving command of the band to Andrуg he 
charged him to lie close and well hid while they were gone. <BR>Now the 
Orc-host was far greater than the band of the outlaws, but they were in lands 
to which Orcs had seldom dared to come, and they knew also that beyond the 
Road lay the Talath Dirnen, the Guarded Plain, upon which the scouts and 
spies of Nargothrond kept watch; and fearing danger they were wary, and 
their scouts went creeping through the trees on either side of the marching 
lines. 
<BR>Thus it was that Turin and Orleg were discovered, for three scouts 
stumbled upon them as they lay hid; and though they slew two the third 
escaped, crying as he ran Golug! Golug! Now that was a name which they had 
for the Noldor. At once the forest was filled with Orcs, scattering silently and 
hunting far and wide. Then Turin, seeing that there was small hope of 
escape, thought at least to deceive them and to lead them away from the 
hiding-place of his men; and perceiving from the cry of Golug! that they 
feared the spies of Nargothrond, he fled with Orleg westward. The pursuit came 
swiftly after them, until turn and dodge as they would they were driven at 
last out of the forest; and then they were espied, and as they sought to 
cross the Road Orleg was shot down by many arrows. But Turin was saved by 
his elven-mail, and escaped alone into the wilds beyond; and by speed and 
craft he eluded his enemies, fleeing far into lands that were strange to 
him. Then the Orcs, fearing that the Elves of Nargothrond might be aroused, 
slew their captives and made haste away into the North.

<BR>Then with bitterness he 
/Turin/ turned to the men. "You were cruel," he said, "and cruel without 
need. Never until now have we tormented a prisoner; but to such Orc-work 
such a life as we lead has brought us. Lawless and fruitless all our deeds 
have been, serving only ourselves, and feeding hate in our hearts." 
<BR>/.../ But Turin came up, and rebuked his men. "What have you there?" he 
said. "What need to be so fierce? It is old and small. What harm is in it?" 
<BR>"It bites," said Andrуg, showing his hand that bled. "It is an Orc, or of 
Orc-kin. Kill it!" 
<BR>"It deserved no less, for cheating our hope," said 
another, who had taken the sack. "There is nothing here but roots and small 
stones." 
<BR>"Nay," said Turin, "it is bearded. It is only a Dwarf, I guess. 
Let him up, and speak." 
<BR>So it was that Mim came in to the Tale of the 
Children of Hurin. For he stumbled up on his knees before Turin's feet and 
begged for his life. "I am old," he said, "and poor. Only a Dwarf, as you 
say, and not an Orc. Mim is my name. Do not let them slay me, lord, for no 
cause, as would the Orcs."

<BR>UT/3:1. The Disaster of the Gladden Fields.
<BR>/.../ Suddenly as the sun plunged into cloud they /Isildur 
and his host/ heard the hideous cries of Orcs, and saw them issuing from 
the Forest and moving down the slopes, yelling their war-cries. <BR>If the 
keen-eyed Orcs marked their flight they took no heed. They halted briefly, 
preparing their assault. First they let fly a hail of arrows, and then 
suddenly with a great shout they did as Isildur would have done, and hurled 
a great mass of their chief warriors down the last slope against the 
Dunedain, expecting to break up their shield-wall. But it stood firm. The arrows 
had been unavailing against the Numenorean armour. The great Men lowered 
above the tallest Orcs, and their swords and spears far outreached the 
weapons of their enemies. The onslaught faltered, broke, and retreated, 
leaving the defenders little harmed, unshaken, behind piles of fallen Orcs. 
It seemed to Isildur that the enemy was withdrawing towards the Forest. He 
looked back. The red rim of the sun gleamed out from the clouds as it went 
down behind the mountains; night would soon be falling. He gave orders to 
resume the march at once, but to bend their course down towards the lower 
and flatter ground where the Orcs would have less advantage. Maybe he believed 
that after their costly repulse they would give way, though their scouts 
might follow him during the night and watch his camp. That was the manner 
of Orcs, who were most often dismayed when their prey could turn and bite. 
<BR>But he was mistaken. There was not only cunning in the attack, but fierce 
and relentless hatred. 
<BR>The Orcs of the Mountains were stiffened and 
commanded by grim servants of Barad-dur, sent out long before to watch the 
passes (note 20), and though it was unknown to them the Ring, cut from his 
black hand two years before, was still laden with Sauron's evil will and 
called to all his servants for their aid. The Dunedain had gone scarcely a 
mile when the Orcs moved again. This time they did not charge, but used all 
their forces. They came down on a wide front, which bent into a crescent 
and soon closed into an unbroken ring about the Dunedain. They were silent 
now, and kept at a distance out of the range of the dreaded steelbows of 
Numenor, though the light was fast failing, and Isildur had all too few 
archers for his need. He halted. 
<BR>There was a pause, though the most keen-eyed among the Dunedain said that the Orcs were moving inwards, 
stealthily, step by step. Elendur went to his father, who was standing dark and 
alone, as if lost in thought. "Atarinya," he said, "what of the power that 
would cow these foul creatures and command them to obey you? Is it then of 
no avail?" 
<BR>"Alas, it is not, senya. I cannot use it. I dread the pain of 
touching it. And I have not yet found the strength to bend it to my will. 
It needs one greater than I now know myself to be. My pride has fallen. It 
should go to the Keepers of the Three". 
<BR>At that moment there came a sudden blast of horns, and the Orcs closed in on all sides, flinging themselves 
against the Dunedain with reckless ferocity. Night had come, and hope faded. Men 
were falling; for some of the greater Orcs leaped up, two at a time, and 
dead or alive with their weight bore down a Dunedain, so that other strong 
claws could drag him out and slay him. The Orcs might pay five to one in 
this exchange, but it was too cheap. Ciryon was slain in this way and Aratan 
mortally wounded in an attempt to rescue him. 
<BR>Elendur, not yet harmed, sought Isildur. He was rallying the men on the east side where the assault 
was heaviest, for the Orcs still feared the Elendilmir that he bore on his brow 
and avoided him. Elendur touched him on the shoulder and he turned 
fiercely, thinking an Orc had crept behind. 
<BR>/.../ There he halted, to make sure that he was not pursued; for Orcs could track a fugitive in the dark 
by scent, and needed no eyes. /.../ But to the night-eyed Orcs that lurked there 
on the watch he loomed up, a monstrous shadow of fear, with a piercing eye 
like a star. They loosed their poisoned arrows at it, and fled. Needlessly, 
for Isildur unarmed was pierced through heart and throat, and without a cry 
he fell back into the water. /.../ 
<BR>The tale mentions a young man who survived the slaughter: he was Elendur's esquire, named Estelmo, and was 
one of the last to fall, but was stunned by a club, and not slain, and was found 
alive  under Elendur's body. He heard the words of Isildur and Elendur at 
their parting. There were rescuers who came on the scene too late, but in 
time to disturb the Orcs and prevent their mutilation of the bodies: for 
there were certain Woodmen who got news to Thranduil by runners, and also 
themselves gathered a force to ambush the Orcs of which they got wind, and 
scat-tered, for though victorious their losses had been great, and almost 
all of the great Orcs had fallen: they attempted no such attack again for 
long years after. 
<BR>Note 20. There can be no doubt that Sauron, well-informed 
of the Alliance, had sent out such Orc-troops of the Red Eye as he could 
spare, to do what they could to harry any forces that attempted to shorten 
their road by crossing the Mountains. In the event the main might of 
Gil-galad, together with Isildur and part of the Men of Arnor, had come 
over the Passes of Imladris and Caradhras, and the Orcs were dismayed and 
hid themselves. But they remained alert and watchful, determined to attack 
any companies of Elves or Men that they outnumbered. Thranduil they had let 
pass, for even his diminished army was far too strong for them; but they 
bided their time, for the most part hidden in the Forest, while others 
lurked along the riverbanks. It is unlikely that any news of Sauron's fall 
had reached them, for he had been straitly besieged in Mordor and all his 
forces had been destroyed. If any few had escaped, they had fled far to the 
East with the Ringwraiths. This small detachment in the North, of no 
account, was forgotten. Probably they thought that Sauron had been 
victorious, and the war-scarred army of Thranduil was retreating to hide in 
fastnesses of the Forest. Thus they would be emboldened and eager to win their 
master's praise, though they had not been in the main battles. But it was 
not his praise they would have won, if any had lived long enough to see his 
revival. No tortures would have satisfied his anger with the bungling fools 
who had let slip the greatest prize in Middle-earth; even though they could 
know nothing of the One Ring, which save to Sauron himself was known only 
to the Nine Ringwraiths, its slaves. Yet many have thought that the 
ferocity and determination of their assault on Isildur was in part due to 
the Ring. It was little more than two years since it had left his hand, and 
though it was swiftly cooling it was still heavy with his evil will, and 
seeking all means to return to its lord (as it did again when he recovered 
and was re-housed). So, it is thought, although they did not understand it 
the Orc-chiefs were filled with a fierce desire to destroy the Dunedain and 
capture their leader. Nonetheless it proved in the event that the War of the 
Ring was lost at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. [Author's note.] <BR>

<BR>UT/3:5. The Battles of the Fords of Isen.
<BR>Saruman's eastern force 
came down with unexpected speed; it was much smaller than the western force, but 
more dangerous. In its van were some Dunlending horse-men and a great pack of 
the dreadful Orcish wolfriders, feared by horses (Note 5). Behind them came two 
battalions of the fierce Uruks, heavily armed but trained to move at great speed 
for many miles. The horsemen and wolfriders fell on the horse-herds and picketed 
horses and slew or dispersed them. The garrison of the east bank surprised by 
the sudden assault of the massed Uruks, was swept away, and the Riders that had 
just crossed from the west were caught still in disarray, and though they fought 
desperately they were driven from the Fords along the line of the Isen with the 
Uruks in pursuit.
<BR>As soon as the enemy had gained possession of the eastern 
end of the Fords there appeared a company of men or Orc-men (evidently 
dispatched for the purpose), ferocious, mail-clad, and armed with axes. They 
hastened to the eyot and assailed it from both sides. At the same time Grimbold 
on the west bank was attacked by Saruman's forces on that side of the Isen. As 
he looked eastward, dismayed by the sounds of battle and the hideous Orc-cries 
of victory, he saw the axe-men driving Theodred's men from the shores of the 
eyot towards the low knoll in its centre, and he heard Theodred's great voice 
crying To me, Eorlingas! At once Grimbold, taking a few men that stood near him, 
ran back to the eyot. So fierce was his onset from the rear of the attackers 
that Grimbold, a man of great strength and stature, clove his way through, till 
with two others he reached Theodred standing at bay on the knoll. Too late. As 
he came to his side Theodred fell, hewn down by a great Orc-man. Grimbold slew 
him and stood over the body of Theodred, thinking him dead; and there he would 
himself soon have died, but for the coming of Elfhelm.
<BR>Elfhelm had been 
riding in haste along the horse-road from Edoras, leading four companies in 
answer to Theodred's summons; he was expecting battle, but not yet for some 
days. But near the junction of the horse-road with the road down from the 
Deeping his outriders on the right flank reported that two wolfriders had been 
seen abroad on the fields. Sensing that things were amiss, he did not turn aside 
to Helm's Deep for the night as he had intended but rode with all speed towards 
the Fords. The horse-road turned north-west after its meeting with the 
Deeping-road, but again bent sharply west when level with the Fords, which it 
approached by a straight path of some two miles long. Elfhelm thus heard and saw 
nothing of the fighting between the retreating garrison and the Uruks south of 
the Fords. The sun had sunk and light was failing when he drew near the last 
bend in the road, and there encountered some horses running wild and a few 
fugitives who told him of the disaster. Though his men and horses were now weary 
he rode as fast as he could along the straight, and as he came in sight of the 
east bank he ordered his companies to charge.
<BR>It was the turn of the Isengarders to be surprised. They heard the thunder of hooves, and saw coming 
like black shadows against the darkening East a great host (as it seemed) with 
Elfhelm at its head, and beside him a white standard borne as a guide to those 
that followed. Few stood their ground. Most fled northwards, pursued by two of 
Elfhelm's companies. The others he dismounted to guard the east bank, but at 
once with the men of his own company rushed to the eyot. The axemen were now 
caught between the surviving defenders and the on-slaught of Elfhelm, with both 
banks still held by the Rohirrim. They fought on, but before the end were slain 
to a man. Elf-helm himself, however, sprang up towards the knoll; and there he 
found Grimbold fighting two great axemen for possession of Theodred's body. One 
Elfhelm at once slew, and the other fell before Grimbold.
<BR>They stooped then to lift the body, and found that Theodred still breathed; but he lived only long 
enough to speak his last words: Let me lie here – to keep the Fords till Eomer 
comes! Night fell. A harsh horn sounded, and then all was silent. The attack on 
the west bank ceased, and the enemy there faded away into the dark. The Rohirrim 
held the Fords of Isen; but their losses were heavy, not least in horses; the 
King's son was dead, and they were leaderless, and did not know what might yet 
befall.
<BR>When after a cold and sleepless night the grey light returned there 
was no sign of the Isengarders, save those many that they left dead upon the 
field. Wolves were howling far off, waiting for the living men to depart. Many 
men scattered by the sudden assault of the Isengarders began to return, some 
still mounted, some leading horses recaptured. Later in the morning most of 
Theodred's Riders that had been driven south down the river by a battalion of 
black Uruks came back battle-worn but in good order. They had a like tale to 
tell. They came to a stand on a low hill and prepared to defend. Though they had 
drawn off part of the attacking force of Isengard, retreat south unprovisioned 
was in the end hopeless. The Uruks had resisted any attempt to burst eastwards, 
and were driving them towards the now hostile country of the Dunlendish 
"west-march." But as the Riders prepared to resist their assault, though it was 
now full night, a horn was sounded; and soon they discovered that the enemy had 
gone. They had too few horses to attempt any pursuit, or even to act as scouts, 
so far as that would have availed by night. After some time they began 
cautiously to advance north again, but met no opposition. They thought that the 
Uruks had gone back to reinforce their hold on the Fords, and expected there to 
meet in battle again, and they wondered much to find the Rohirrim in command. It 
was not till later that they discovered whither the Uruks had gone.
<BR>So ended the First Battle of the Fords of Isen.
<P align=justify>Note 5. They were very swift and skilled in avoiding ordered men in close array, being used mostly to destroy 
isolated groups or to hunt down fugitives; but at need they would pass with 
reckless ferocity through any gaps hi companies of horsemen, slashing at the 
bellies of the horses. [Author's note.]
<BR>Note 10. This /vanguard of remnants of Saruman’s host/ was the great host that Meriadoc saw leaving Isengard, as he 
related afterwards to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (The Two Towers III 9): "I saw

great wolves. And there were battalions of Men, too.
<BR>Note 11. They /men of Saruman’s hosts/ were without body-armour, having only among them a few hauberks 
gained by theft or in loot. The Rohirrim had the advan-tage in being supplied by 
the metal-workers of Gondor. In Isengard as yet only the heavy and clumsy mail 
of the Orcs was made, by them for their own uses. [Author's

<BR>UT/4:1. The Druedain.
<BR>The Folk of Haleth called them 
/drughu/ by the name drug, that being a word of their own language. To the eyes 
of Elves and other Men they were unlovely in looks: they were stumpy (some four 
foot high) but very broad, with heavy buttocks and short thick legs; their wide 
faces had deep-set eyes with heavy brows, and flat noses, and grew no hair below 
their eyebrows, except in a few men (who were proud of the distinction) a small 
tail of black hair in the midst of the chin. Their features were usually 
impassive, the most mobile being their wide mouths; and the movement of their 
wary eyes could not be observed save from close at hand for they were so black 
that the pupils could not be distinguished, but in anger they glowed red. Their 
voices were deep and guttural, but their laughter was a surprise: it was rich 
and rolling, and set all who heard it. Elves or Men, laughing too for its pure 
merriment untainted by scorn or malice (5). In peace they often laughed at work 
or play when other Men might sing. 
<BR>But they could be relentless enemies, and 
when once aroused their red wrath was slow to cool, though it showed no sign 
save light in their eyes; for they fought in silence and did not exult -victory, 
not even over Orcs, the only creatures for whom their hatred was 
implacable.
<BR>The Eldar called them Druedain, admitting them to the rank of 
Atani (6), for they were much loved while they lasted. Alas! they were not 
long-lived, and were ever few in number, their losses were heavy in their feud 
with the Orcs, who turned their hatred and delighted to capture them and torture 
them. When the victories of Morgoth destroyed all the realms and strongholds of 
Elves and Men in Beleriand, it is said that they had dwindled to a few families, 
mostly of women and children, some of whom came to the last refuges at the Mouth 
Sirion. 
<BR>In their earlier days they had been of great service to those among 
whom they dwelt, and they were much sought after; though few would ever leave 
the land of the Folk of Haleth. They had a marvellous skill as trackers of all 
living creatures and they taught to their friends what they could of their 
craft; but their pupils did not equal them, for the Druedain used their scent, 
like hounds save that they were also keen-eyed. They boasted that they could 
smell an Orc to windward further away than other Men could see them, and could 
follow its scent for weeks except through running water. Their knowledge of all 
growing things was almost equal to that of the Elves (though untaught by them); 
and it is said that if they removed to a new country they knew within a short 
time all things that grew there, great or minute, and gave names to those that 
were new to them, discerning those that were poisonous, or useful as 
food.<BR>Sometimes these imaes were strange and fantastic, or even fearful: 
among the grim jests to which they put their skill was the making of Orc-figures 
which they set at the borders of the land, shaped as if fleeing from it, 
shrieking in terror. They made also images of themselves and placed them at the 
entrances to tracks or at turnings of woodland paths. These they called 
"watch-stones;" of which the most notable were set near the Crossings of 
Teiglin, each representing a Druadan, larger than the life, squatting heavily 
upon a dead Orc. These figures served not merely as insults to their enemies; 
for the Orcs feared them and believed them to be filled with the malice of the 
Oghor-hai (for so they named the Druedain), and able to hold communication with 
them.
<BR>/.../ Marauding Orcs carried with them brimstone or some other devilish 
stuff that was quickly inflamed and not quenched with water./further its called 
Orc-fire/
<BR>Note 4. After the fashion in which in the Third Age the Men and 
Hobbits of Bree lived together; though there was no kinship between the 
Drug-folk and the Hobbits. [Author's note.]
<BR>Note 5. To the unfriendly who, 
not knowing them well, declared that Mor-goth must have bred the Orcs from such 
a stock the Eldar an-swered: "Doubtless Morgoth, since he can make no living 
thing, bred Orcs from various kinds of Men, but the Druedain must have escaped 
his Shadow; for their laughter and the laughter of Orcs are as different as is 
the light of Aman from the darkness of Angband." But some thought, nonetheless, 
that there had been a remote kinship, which accounted for their special enmity. 
Orcs and Drugs each regarded the other as renegades. [Author's note.] 
<BR>In The 
Silmarillion the Orcs are said to have been bred by Melkor from captured Elves 
in the beginning of their days (p. 50; cf. pp. 93-4); but this was only one of 
several diverse speculations on the origin of the Orcs. It may be noted that in 
The Return of the King V 5 a laughter of Ghan-buri-Ghan is described: "At that 
old Ghan made a curious gurgling noise, and it seemed that he was laughing." He 
is described as having a scanty beard that "straggled on his lumpy chin like dry 
moss," and dark eyes that showed nothing.
<BR>Note 6. It is stated in isolated 
notes that their own name for themselves was Drughu (in which the gh represents 
a spirantal sound). This name adopted into Sindarin in Beleriand became Dru 
(plurals Druin and Druath), but when the Eldar discovered that the Dru-folk were 
steadfast enemies of Morgoth, and especially of the Orcs, the "title" adan was 
added, and they were called Druedain (singular Druadan), to mark both their 
humanity and friendship with the Eldar, and their racial difference from the 
people of the Three Houses of the Edain.
<BR>Note 9. They had a law against the 
use of all poisons for the hurt of any living creatures, even those who had done 
them injury, save only Orcs, whose poisoned darts they countered with others 
more deadly. [Author's note.] Elfhelm told Meriadoc Brandybuck that the Wild Men 
used poisoned arrows (The Return of the King V 5), and the same was believed of 
them by the inhabitants of Enedwaith in the Second Age (p. 400).
<BR>Note 14. 
Once in The Lord of the Rings the term "Woses" is used, when Elfhelm said to 
Meriadoc Brandybuck: "You hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods." Wose is a 
modernization (in this case, the form that the word would have had now if it 
still existed in the language) of an Anglo-Saxon word waesa, which is actually 
found only in the compound wudu-waesa "wild man of the woods." (Saeros the Elf 
of Doriath called Turin a "woodwose," p. 85 above The word survived long in 
English and was eventually corrupted into "wood-house.") The actual word 
employed by the Rohirrim (of which "wose" is a translation, according to the 
method employed throughout) is once mentioned: rog, plural rogin.
<BR>It seems 
that the term "Pukel-men" (again a translation: it represents Anglo-Saxon pucel 
"goblin, demon," a relative of the word puca from which Puck is derived) was 
only used in Rohan of the images of Dunharrow.

<BR>Note 7. /.../ The Council seems to have been unaware, since for 
many years Isengard had been closely guarded, of what went on within its Ring. 
The use, and possibly special breeding, of Orcs was kept secret, and cannot have 
begun much before 2990 at earliest. The Orc-troops seem never to have been used 
beyond the territory of Isengard before the attack on Rohan. Had the Council 
known of this they would, of course, at once have realized that Saruman had 
become evil. [Author's note.]

Durin’s Folk.
<BR>When Thror came to Moria the Gate was open. Nar begged him to 
beware, but he took no heed of him, and walked proudly in as an heir that 
returns. But he did not come back. Nar stayed near by for many days in hiding. 
One day he heard a loud shout and the blare of a horn, and a body was flung out 
on the steps. Fearing that it was Thrуr, he began to creep near, but there came 
a voice from within the gate: 
<BR>'Come on, beardling! We can see you. But there 
is no need to be afraid today. We need you as a messenger.' 
<BR>Then Nar came 
up, and found that it was indeed the body of Thrуr, but the head was severed and 
lay face downwards. As he knelt there, he heard orc-laughter in the shadows, and 
the voice said: 
<BR>'If beggars will not wait at the door, but sneak in to try 
thieving, that is what we do to them. If any of your people poke their foul 
beards in here again, they will fare the same. Go and tell them so! But if his 
family wish to know who is now king here, the name is written on his face. I 
wrote it! I killed him! I am the master! ' 
<BR>Then Nar turned the head and saw 
branded on the brow in Dwarf-runes so that he could read it the name AZOG. That 
name was branded in his heart and in the hearts of all the Dwarves afterwards. 
 Nar stooped to take the head, but the voice of Azog /Father of Bolg/ said: 
<BR>'Drop it! Be off! Here's your fee, beggar-beard.' A small bag struck him. It 
held a few coins of little worth. 
<BR>Weeping, Nar fled down the Silverlode; but 
he looked back once and saw that Orcs had come from the gate and were hacking up 
the body and flinging the pieces to the black crows. Such was the tale that Nar 
brought back to Thrain; and when he had wept and torn his beard he fell silent. 
Seven days he sat and said no word. Then he stood up and said: 'This cannot be 
borne!' That was the beginning of the War of the Dwarves and the Orcs, which was 
long and deadly, and fought for the most part in deep places beneath the 
earth.
<BR>Thrain at once sent messengers bearing the tale, north, east, and 
west; but it was three years before the Dwarves had mustered their strength. 
Durin's Folk gathered all their host, and they were joined by great forces sent 
from the Houses of other Fathers; for this dishonour to the heir of the Eldest 
of their race filled them with wrath. When all was ready they assailed and 
sacked one by one all the strongholds of the Orcs that they could from Gundabad 
to the Gladden. Both sides were pitiless, and there was death and cruel deeds by 
dark and by light. But the Dwarves had the victory through their strength, and 
their matchless weapons, and the fire of their anger, as they hunted for Azog in 
every den under mountain. 
<BR>At last all the Orcs that fled before them were 
gathered in Moria, and the Dwarf-host in pursuit came to Azanulbizar. That was a 
great vale that lay between the arms of the mountains about the lake of 
Kheled-zaram and had been of old part of the kingdom of Khazad-dum. When the 
Dwarves saw the gate of their ancient mansions upon the hill-side they sent up a 
great shout like thunder in the valley. But a great host of foes was arrayed on 
the slopes above them, and out of the gates poured a multitude of Orcs that had 
been held back by Azog for the last need. 
<BR>At first fortune was against the Dwarves; for it was a dark day of winter without sun, and the Orcs did not 
waver, and they outnumbered their enemies, and had the higher ground. So began 
the Battle of Azanulbizar (or Nanduhirion in the Elvish tongue), at the memory 
of which the Orcs still shudder and the Dwarves weep. The first assault of the 
vanguard led by Thrain was thrown back with loss, and Thrain was driven into a 
wood of great trees that then still grew not far from Kheled-zaram. There Frerin 
his son fell, and Fundin his kinsman, and many others, and both Thrain and 
Thorin were wounded. Elsewhere the battle swayed to and fro with great 
slaughter, until at last the people of the Iron Hills turned the day. Coming 
late and fresh to the field the mailed warriors of Nain, Grуr's son, drove 
through the Orcs to the very threshold of Moria, crying 'Azog! Azog! ' as they 
hewed down with their mattocks all who stood in their way. 
<BR>Then Nain stood before the Gate and cried with a great voice: 'Azog! If you are in come out! Or 
is the play in the valley too rough?' 
<BR>Thereupon Azog came forth, and he was a great Orc with a huge iron-clad head, and yet agile and strong. With him came 
many like him, the fighters of his guard, and as they engaged Nain's company he 
turned to Nain, and said: 
<BR>'What? Yet another beggar at my doors? Must I brand you too?' With that he rushed at Nain and they fought. But Nain was half 
blind with rage, and also very weary with battle, whereas Azog was fresh and 
fell and full of guile. Soon Nain made a great stroke with all his strength that 
remained, but Azog darted aside and kicked Nain's leg, so that the mattock 
splintered on the stone where he had stood, but Nain stumbled forward. Then Azog 
with a swift swing hewed his neck. His mail-collar withstood the edge, but so 
heavy was the blow that Nain's neck was broken and he fell. 
<BR>Then Azog laughed, and he lifted up his head to let forth a great yell of triumph; but the 
cry died in his throat. For he saw that all his host in the valley was in a 
rout, and the Dwarves went this way and that slaying as they would, and those 
that could escape from them were flying south, shrieking as they ran. And hard 
by all the soldiers of his guard lay dead. He turned and fled back towards the 
Gate. 
<BR>Up the steps after him leaped a Dwarf with a red axe. It was Dain 
Ironfoot, Nain's son. Right before the doors he caught Azog, and there he slew 
him, and hewed off his head. That was held a great feat, for Dain was then only 
a stripling in the reckoning of the Dwarves. But long life and many battles lay 
before him, until old but unbowed he fell at last in the War of the Ring. Yet 
hardy and full of wrath as he was, it is said that when he came down from the 
Gate he looked grey in the face, as one who has felt great fear. 
<BR>When at last the battle was won the Dwarves that were left gathered in Azanulbizar. They 
took the head of Azog and thrust into its mouth the purse of small money, and 
then they set it on a stake. But no feast nor song was there that night; for 
their dead were beyond the count of grief. Barely half of their number, it is 
said, could still stand or had hope of healing. 
<BR>/.../<BR>Little is known of what happened to him /Thrain/ afterwards. It would now seem that as soon as he 
was abroad with few companions he was hunted by the emissaries of Sauron. Wolves 
pursued him, Orcs waylaid him, evil birds shadowed his path, and the more he 
strove to go north the more misfortunes opposed him.

<A NAME="fr228a"></A><BR><B>a.</B> 
Silmarillion-1977. Valaquenta. Of the Valar.
<BR>Orome is a mighty lord. /.../ 
Orome loved the lands of Middle-earth, and he left them unwillingly and came 
last to Valinor; and often of old he passed back east over the mountains and 
returned with his host to the hills and the plains. He is a hunter of monsters 
and fell beasts, and he delights in horses and in hounds; and all trees he 
loves, for which reason he is called Aldaron, and by the Sindar Tauron, the Lord 
of Forests. Nahar is the name of his horse, white in the sun, and shining silver 
at night. The Valaroma is the name of his great horn, the sound of which is like 
the upgoing of the Sun in scarlet, or the sheer lightning cleaving the clouds. 
Above all the horns of his host it was heard in the woods that Yavanna brought 
forth in Valinor; for there Orome would train his folk and his beasts for the 
pursuit of the evil creatures of Melkor.
<A NAME="fr228b"></A><BR><BR><B>b.</B> Silmarillion-1977. Valaquenta. Of 
the Maiar.
<BR>Yet so great was the power of his /Melkor’s/ uprising that in ages 
forgotten he contended with Manwe and all the Valar, and through long years in 
Arda held dominion over most of the lands of the Earth. But he was not alone. 
For of the Maiar many were drawn to his splendour in the days of his greatness, 
and remained in that allegiance down into his darkness; and others he corrupted 
afterwards to his service with lies and treacherous gifts. Dreadful among these 
spirits were the Valaraukar, the scourges of fire that in Middle-earth were 
called the Balrogs, demons of terror.
<BR>Among those of his servants that have 
names the greatest was that spirit whom the Eldar called Sauron, or Gorthaur the 
Cruel. In his beginning he was of the Maiar of Aule, and he remained mighty in 
the lore of that people. In all the deeds of Melkor the Morgoth upon Arda, in 
his vast works and in the deceits of his cunning, Sauron had a part, and was 
only less evil than his master in that for long he served another and not 
himself. But in after years he rose like a shadow of Morgoth and a ghost of his 
malice, and walked behind him on the same ruinous path down into the Void.

Silmarillion-1977. Quenta Silmarillion /Silmarillion/. 1. Of the Beginning of 
Days. 
<BR>/After Lamps’ construction, during the «Almaren period»/. And Melkor 
knew of an that was done, for even then he had secret friends and spies among 
the Maiar whom he had converted to his cause; and far off in the darkness he was 
filled with hatred, being jealous of the work of his peers, whom he desired to 
make subject to himself. Therefore he gathered to himself spirits out of the 
halls of Ea that he had perverted to his service, and he deemed himself strong. 
And seeing now his time he drew near again to Arda, and looked down upon it, and 
the beauty of the Earth in its Spring filled him the more with hate.
<BR>Now 
therefore the Valar were gathered upon Almaren, fearing no evil, and because of 
the light of Illuin they did not perceive the shadow in the north that was cast 
from afar by Melkor; for he was grown dark as the Night of the Void. /.../ and 
Melkor deemed that his hour had come. And he passed therefore over the Walls of 
the Night with his host, and came to Middle-earth far in the north; and the 
Valar were not aware of him.
<BR>Now Melkor began the delving and building of a 
vast fortress, deep under Earth, beneath dark mountains where the beams of 
Illuin were cold and dim. That stronghold was named Utumno. And though the Valar 
knew naught of it as yet, nonetheless the evil of Melkor and the blight of his 
hatred flowed out thence, and the Spring of Arda was marred.

<BR>/Before the Awakening of Elves/
<BR>But in the north Melkor built his strength, and he slept not, but watched, and 
laboured; and the evil things that he had perverted walked abroad, and the dark 
and slumbering woods were haunted by monsters and shapes of dread. And in Utumno 
he gathered his demons about him, those spirits who first adhered to him in the 
days of his splendour, and became most like him in his corruption: their hearts 
were of fire, but they were cloaked in darkness, and terror went before them; 
they had whips of flame. Balrogs they were named in Middle-earth in later days. 
And in that dark time Melkor bred many other monsters of divers shapes and kinds 
that long troubled the world; and his realm spread now ever southward over 
Middle-earth.
<BR>And Melkor made also a fortress and armoury not far from the 
north-western shores of the sea, to resist any assault that might come from 
Aman. That stronghold was commanded by Sauron, lieutenant of Melkor; and it was 
named Angband.
<A NAME="fr228e"></A><BR><BR><B>e.</B> Silmarillion-1977. Quenta Silmarillion /Silmarillion/. 3. 
Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor.
<BR>/After Elves’ 
Awakening, before Battle of Powers and elves’ march to the West, long before 
Men’ awakening; note that in The Silmarillion Men’ awakening takes part with 
first Sunrise, i.e. soon after Feanor’s death /
<BR>Yet many of the Quendi were 
filled with dread at his /Orome’s/ coming; and this was the doing of Melkor. For 
by after-knowledge the wise declare that Melkor, ever watchful, was first aware 
of the awakening of the Quendi, and sent shadows and evil spirits to spy upon 
them and waylay them. So it came to pass, some years ere the coming of Orome, 
that if any of the Elves strayed far abroad, alone or few together, they would 
often vanish, and never return; and the Quendi said that the Hunter had caught 
them, and they were afraid. And indeed the most ancient songs of the Elves, of 
which echoes are remembered still in the West, tell of the shadow-shapes that 
walked in the hills above Cuivienen, or would pass suddenly over the stars; and 
of the dark Rider upon his wild horse that pursued those that wandered to take 
them and devour them. Now Melkor greatly hated and feared the riding of Orome, 
and either he sent indeed his dark servants as riders, or he set lying whispers 
abroad, for the purpose that the Quendi should shun Orome, if ever they should 
meet.
<BR>Thus it was that when Nahar neighed and Orome indeed came among them, 
some of the Quendi hid themselves, and some fled and were lost. But those that 
had courage, and stayed, perceived swiftly that the Great Rider was no shape out 
of darkness; for the light of Aman was in his face, and all the noblest of the 
Elves were drawn towards it.
<BR>But of those unhappy ones who were ensnared by 
Melkor little is known of a certainty. For who of the living has descended into 
the pits of Utumno, or has explored the darkness of the counsels of Melkor? Yet 
this is held true by the wise of Eressea /*/, that all those of the Quendi who 
came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, 
and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and enslaved; and thus did Melkor 
breed the hideous race of the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves, of whom 
they were afterwards the bitterest foes. For the Orcs had life and multiplied 
after the manner of the Children of Iluvatar; and naught that had life of its 
own, nor the semblance of life, could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in 
the Ainulindale before the Beginning: so say the wise. And deep in their dark 
hearts the Orcs loathed the Master whom they served in fear, the maker only of 
their misery. This it may be was the vilest deed of Melkor, and the most hateful 
to Iluvatar.
<BR>/*Note that «held true» means not neccesary «they held it, and 
it is true», but more like «held to be true», so it’s opinion of the wise of 
Eressea, not necessarily of Simarillion’s author himself/.

<BR>Nonetheless the Valar did not 
discover all the mighty vaults and caverns hidden with deceit far under the 
fortresses of Angband and Utumno. Many evil things still lingered there, and 
others were dispersed and fled into the dark and roamed in the waste places of 
the world, awaiting a more evil hour; and Sauron they did not find.
<BR>/.../ 
Then befell the first sundering of the Elves. For the kindred of Ingwe, and the 
most part of the kindreds of Finwe and Elwe, were swayed by the words of their 
lords, and were willing to depart and follow Orome; and these were known ever 
after as the Eldar, by the name that Orome gave to the Elves in the beginning, 
in their own tongue. But many refused the summons, preferring the starlight and 
the wide spaces of Middle-earth to the rumour of the Trees; and these are the 
Avari, the Unwilling, and they were sundered in that time from the Eldar, and 
met never again until many ages were past.
<BR>/.../ These were the three 
kindreds of the Eldalie, who passing at length into the uttermost West in the 
days of the Trees are called the Calaquendi, Elves of the Light. But others of 
the Eldar there were who set out indeed upon the westward march, but became lost 
upon the long road, or turned aside, or lingered on the shores of Middle-earth; 
and these were for the most part of the kindred of the Teleri, as is told 
hereafter. They dwelt by the sea or wandered in the woods and mountains of the 
world, yet their hearts were turned towards the West. Those Elves the Calaquendi 
call the +manyar, since they came never to the land of Aman and the Blessed 
Realm; but the +manyar and the Avari alike they call the Moriquendi, Elves of 
the Darkness, for they never beheld the Light that was before the Sun and 
Moon.

up from the south through the dark forests. Wolves there were, or creatures that 
walked in wolf-shapes, and other fell beings of shadow; and among them were the 
Orcs, who afterwards wrought ruin in Beleriand: but they were yet few and wary, 
and did but smell out the ways of the land, awaiting the return of their lord. 
Whence they came, or what they were, the Elves knew not then, thinking them 
perhaps to be Avari who had become evil and savage in the wild; in which they 
guessed all too near, it is said.

power of Morgoth. And he being freed gathered again all his servants that he 
could find, and came to the ruins of Angband. There he delved anew his vast 
vaults and dungeons, and above their gates he reared the threefold peaks of 
Thangorodrim, and a great reek of dark smoke was ever wreathed about them. There 
countless became the hosts of his beasts and his demons, and the race of the 
Orcs, bred long before, grew and multiplied in the bowels of the earth. Dark now 
fell the shadow on Beleriand, as is told hereafter, but in Angband Morgoth 
forged for himself a great crown of iron, and he called himself King of the 
World.

Voyage of Earendil and the War of Wrath.
<BR>The meeting of the hosts of the West 
and of the North is named the Great Battle, and the War of Wrath. There was 
marshalled the whole power of the Throne of Morgoth, and it had become great 
beyond count, so that Anfauglith could not contain it; and all the North was 
aflame with war.
<BR>But it availed him not. The Balrogs were destroyed, save 
some few that fled and hid themselves in caverns inaccessible at the roots of 
the earth; and the uncounted legions of the Orcs perished like straw in a great 
fire, or were swept like shrivelled leaves before a burning wind. Few remained 
to trouble the world for long years after. And such few as were left of the 
three houses of the Elf-friends, Fathers of Men, fought upon the part of the 
Valar /.../. But a great part of the sons of Men, whether of the people of Uldor 
or others new-come out of the east, marched with the Enemy; and the Elves do not 
forget it.
<BR>Then, seeing that his hosts were overthrown and his power 
dispersed, Morgoth quailed, and he dared not to come forth himself. But he 
loosed upon his foes the last desperate assault that he had prepared, and out of 
the pits of Angband there issued the winged dragons, that had not before been 
seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the 
host of the Valar was driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great 
thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire.
<BR>But Earendil came, shining 
with white flame, and about Vingilot were gathered all the great birds of heaven 
and Thorondor was their captain, and there was battle in the air all the day and 
through a dark night of doubt. Before the rising of the sun Earendil slew 
Ancalagon the Black, the mightiest of the dragon-host, and cast him from the 
sky; and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim, and they were broken in his 
ruin. Then the sun rose, and the host of the Valar prevailed, and well-nigh all 
the dragons were destroyed; and all the pits of Morgoth were broken and 
unroofed, and the might of the Valar descended into the deeps of the earth. 
There Morgoth stood at last at bay, and yet unvaliant. He fled into the deepest 
of his mines, and sued for peace and pardon; but his feet were hewn from under 
him, and he was hurled upon his face. Then he was bound with the chain Angainor 
which he had worn aforetime, and his iron crown they beat into a collar for his 
neck, and his head was bowed upon his knees.

<BR>And after the victory of the Lords of 
the West those of the evil Men who were not destroyed fled back into the east, 
where many of their race were still wandering in the unharvested lands, wild and 
lawless, refusing alike the summons of the Valar and of Morgoth. And the evil 
Men came among them, and cast over them a shadow of fear, and they took them for 
kings. Then the Valar forsook for a time the Men of Middle-earth who had refused 
their summons and had taken the friends of Morgoth to be their masters; and Men 
dwelt in darkness and were troubled by many evil things that Morgoth had devised 
in the days of his dominion: demons, and dragons, and misshapen beasts, and the 
unclean Orcs that are mockeries of the Children of Iluvatar. And the lot of Men 
was unhappy.

<BR>Now Sauron's lust and pride increased, until he 
knew no bounds, and he determined to make himself master of all things in 
Middle-earth, and to destroy the Elves, and to compass, if he might, the 
downfall of Numenor. He brooked no freedom nor any rivalry, and he named himself 
Lord of the Earth. A mask he still could wear so that if he wished he might 
deceive the eyes of Men, seeming to them wise and fair. But he ruled rather by 
force and fear, if they might avail; and those who perceived his shadow 
spreading over the world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; and 
he gathered again under his government all the evil things of the days of 
Morgoth that remained on earth or beneath it, and the Orcs were at his command 
and multiplied like flies. Thus the Black Years began, which the Elves call the 
Days of Flight. In that time many of the Elves of Middle-earth fled to Lindon 
and thence over the seas never to return; and many were destroyed by Sauron and 
his servants. But in Lindon Gil-galad still maintained his power, and Sauron 
dared not as yet to pass the Mountains of Ered Luin nor to assail the Havens; 
and Gil-galad was aided by the Numenoreans. Elsewhere Sauron reigned, and those 
who would be free took refuge in the fastnesses of wood and mountain, and ever 
fear pursued them. In the east and south well nigh all Men were under his 
dominion, and they grew strong in those days and built many towns and walls of 
stone, and they were numerous and fierce in war and aimed with iron. To them 
Sauron was both king and god; and they feared him exceedingly, for he surrounded 
his abode with fire.

'realistic' fiction: your vigorous words well describe the tribe /on some

Tolkienns imaginatory world they are on one side only/, of course. For 'romance' 
has grown out of 'allegory', and its wars are still derived from the 'inner war' 
of allegory in which good is on one side and various modes of badness on the 
other. In real (exterior) life men are on both sides: which means a motley 
alliance of orcs, beasts, demons, plain naturally honest men, and angels. But it 
does make some difference who are your captains and whether they are orc-like

<BR>Orcs (the word is as far 
as I am concerned actually derived from Old English orc 'demon', but only 
because of its phonetic suitability) are nowhere clearly stated to be of any 
particular origin. But since they are servants of the Dark Power, and later of 
Sauron, neither of whom could, or would, produce living things, they must be 
'corruptions'. They are not based on direct experience of mine; but owe, I 
suppose, a good deal to the goblin tradition (goblin is used as a translation in 
The Hobbit, where orc only occurs once, I think), especially as it appears in 
George MacDonald, except for the soft feet which I never believed in. The name 
has the form orch (pl. yrch) in Sindarin and uruk in the Black Speech.
<BR>The Black Speech was only used in Mordor; it only occurs in the Ring inscription, 
and a sentence uttered by the Orcs of Barad-dur (Vol. II p. 48), and in the word 
Nazgul (cf. nazg in the Ring inscription). It was never used willingly by any 
other people, and consequently even the names of places in Mordor are in English 
(for the C.S.) or Elvish. Morannon is just the Elvish for Black Gate; cf. Mordor 
Black Land, Mor-ia Black Chasm, Mor-thond Black-root (river-name). Rohir-rim is 
the Elvish (Gondorian) name for the people that called themselves Riders of the 
Mark or Eorlings. The formation is not meant to resemble Hebrew. The Eldarin 
languages distinguish in forms and use between a 'partitive' or 'particular' 
plural, and the general or total plural. Thus yrch 'orcs, some orcs, des orques' 
occurs in vol I pp. 359,402; the Orcs, as a race, or the whole of a group 
previously mentioned would have been orchoth. In Grey-elven the general plurals 
were very frequently made by adding to a name (or a place-name) some word 
meaning 'tribe, host, horde, people'. So Haradrim the Southrons: Q. rimbe, S. 
rim, host; Onod-rim the Ents. The Rohirrim is derived from roch (Q. rokko) 
horse, and the Elvish stem kher- 'possess'; whence Sindarin Rochir 'horse-lord', 
and Rochir-rim 'the host of the Horse-lords'. In the pronunciation of Gondor the 
ch (as in German, Welsh, etc) had been softened to a sounded h; so in Rochann 
'Hippia' to Rohan.
<BR>Beorn is dead; see vol. I p. 241. He appeared in The 
Hobbit. It was then the year Third Age 2940 (Shire-reckoning 1340). We are now 
in the years 3018-19 (1418-19). Though a skin-changer and no doubt a bit of a 
magician /NB. To the question of magucs’ existence in Middle-Earth/, Beorn was a 
Man.
<BR>Tom Bombadil is not an important person to the narrative. I suppose he 
has some importance as a 'comment'. I mean, I do not really write like that: he 
is just an invention (who first appeared in the Oxford Magazine about 1933), and 
he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to 
analyze the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, if he did 
not have some kind of function. I might put it this way. The story is cast in 
terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny 
against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has 
long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, 
conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. but if you have, as it 
were taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in 
things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to 
some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and 
control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite 
valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when 
there is a war. But the view of Rivendell seems to be that it is an excellent 
thing to have represented, but that there are in fact things with which it 
cannot cope; and upon which its existence nonetheless depends. Ultimately only 
the victory of the West will allow Bombadil to continue, or even to survive. 
Nothing would be left for him in the world of Sauron.
<BR>He has no connexion in my mind with the Entwives. What had happened to them is not resolved in this 
book. He is in a way the answer to them in the sense that he is almost the 
opposite, being say, Botany and Zoology (as sciences) and Poetry as opposed to 
Cattle-breeding and Agriculture and practicality.
<BR>I think that in fact the Entwives had disappeared for good, being destroyed with their gardens in the War 
of the Last Alliance (Second Age 3429-3441) when Sauron pursued a scorched earth 
policy and burned their land against the advance of the Allies down the Anduin 
(vol. II p. 79 refers to it). They survived only in the 'agriculture' 
transmitted to Men (and Hobbits). Some, of course, may have fled east, or even 
have become enslaved: tyrants even in such tales must have an economic and 
agricultural background to their soldiers and metal-workers. If any survived so, 
they would indeed be far estranged from the Ents, and any rapprochement would be 
difficult, unless experience of industrialized and militarized agriculture had 
made them a little more anarchic. I hope so. I don't know.
<BR>...The Balrog is a survivor from the Silmarillion and the legends of the First Age. So is Shelob. 
The Balrogs, of whom the whips were the chief weapons, were primeval spirits of 
destroying fire, chief servants of the primeval Dark Power of the First Age. 
They were supposed to have been all destroyed in the overthrow of Thangorodrim, 
his fortress in the North. But it is here found (there is usually a hang-over 
especially of evil from one age to another) that one had escaped and taken 
refuge under the mountains of Hithaeglin (the Misty Mountains). It is observable 
that only the Elf knows what the thing is, and doubtless Gandalf.
<BR>Shelob (English representing C.S 'she-lob' = female spider) is a translation of Elvish 
Ungol 'spider'. She is represented in vol. II p. 332 as descendant of the giant 
spiders of the glens of Nandungorthin, which come into the legends of the First 
Age, especially into the chief of them, the tale of Beren and L·thien. This is 
constantly referred to, since as Sam points out (vol. II p. 321) this history is 
in a sense only a further continuation of it. Both Elrond (and his daughter 
Arwen Undomiel, who resembles Luthien closely in looks and fate) are descendants 
of Beren and Luthien; and so at very many more removes is Aragorn. The giant 
spiders were themselves only the offspring of Ungoliante the primeval devourer 
of light, that in spider-form assisted the Dark Power, but ultimately quarrelled 
with him. There is thus no alliance between Shelob and Sauron, the Dark Power's 
deputy; only a common hatred.
<BR>Galadriel is as old, or older than Shelob. She 
is the last remaining of the Great among the High Elves, and 'awoke' in Eldamar 
beyond the Sea, long before Ungoliante came to Middle-earth and produced her 
broods there. ....

<BR>Your preference of goblins to orcs involves a 
large question and a matter of taste, and perhaps historical pedantry on my pan. 
Personally I prefer Orcs (since these creatures are not 'goblins', not even the 
goblins of George MacDonald, which they do to some extent resemble). Also I now 
deeply regret having used Elves, though this is a word in ancestry and original 
meaning suitable enough. But the disastrous debasement of this word, in which 
Shakespeare played an unforgiveable pan, has really overloaded it with 
regrettable tones, which are too much to overcome. I hope in the Appendices to 
Vol. III to be able to include a note 'On translation' in which the matter of 
equivalences and my uses may be made clearly. My difficulty has been that, since 
I have tried to present a kind of legendary and history of a 'forgotten epoch', 
all the specific terms were in a foreign language, and no precise equivalents 
exist in English. 
<A NAME="fr252"></A><P align=justify><b>Fr.252</b>
<BR>Letters. Letter 153.
<BR>As for other points. 
I think I agree about the 'creation by evil'. But you are more free with the 
word 'creation' than I am*. Treebeard does not say that the Dark Lord 'created' 
Trolls and Orcs. He says he 'made' them in counterfeit of certain creatures 
pre-existing. There is, to me, a wide gulf between the two statements, so wide 
that Treebeard's statement could (in my world) have possibly been true. It is 
not true actually of the Orcs who are fundamentally a race of 'rational 
incarnate' creatures, though horribly corrupted, if no more so than many Men to 
be met today. Treebeard is a character in my story, not me; and though he has a 
great memory and some earthy wisdom, he is not one of the Wise, and there is 
quite a lot he does not know or understand. He does not know what 'wizards' are, 
or whence they came (though I do, even if exercising my subcreator's right I 
have thought it best in this Tale to leave the question a 'mystery', not without 
pointers to the solution).
<BR>Suffering and experience (and possibly the Ring 
itself) gave Frodo more insight; and you will read in Ch. I of Book VI the words 
to Sam. 'The Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make real new things 
of its own. I don't think it gave life to the Orcs, it only ruined them and 
twisted them.' In the legends of the Elder Days it is suggested that the 
Diabolus subjugated and corrupted some of the earliest Elves, before they had 
ever heard of the 'gods', let alone of God.
<BR>I am not sure about Trolls. I 
think they are mere 'counterfeits', and hence (though here I am of course only 
using elements of old barbarous mythmaking that had no 'aware' metaphysic) they 
return to mere stone images when not in the dark. But there are other sorts of 
Trolls beside these rather ridiculous, if brutal, Stone-trolls, for which other 
origins are suggested. Of course (since inevitably my world is highly imperfect 
even on its own plane nor made wholly coherent our Real World does not appear 
to be wholly coherent either; and I am actually not myself convinced that, 
though in every world on every plane all must ultimately be under the Will of 
God, even in ours there are not some 'tolerated' sub-creational counterfeits!) 
when you make Trolls speak you are giving them a power, which in our world 
(probably) connotes the possession of a 'soul'. But I do not agree (if you admit 
that fairy-story element) that my trolls show any sign of 'good', strictly and 
unsentimentally viewed. I do not say William felt pity, a word to me of moral 
and imaginative worth: it is the Pity of Bilbo and later Frodo that ultimately 
allows the Quest to be achieved, and I do not think he showed Pity. I might not 
(if The Hobbit had been more carefully written, and my world so much thought 
about 20 years ago) have used the expression 'poor little blighter', just as I 
should not have called the troll William. But I discerned no pity even then, and 
put in a plain caveat. Pity must restrain one from doing something immediately 
desirable and seemingly advantageous. There is no more 'pity' here than in a 
beast of prey yawning, or lazily patting a creature it could eat, but does not 
want to, since it is not hungry. Or indeed than there is in many of men's 
actions, whose real roots are in satiety, sloth, or a purely non-moral natural 
softness, though they may dignify them by 'pity's' name.
<BR>...To conclude: 
having mentioned Free Will, I might say that in my myth I have used 
'subcreation' in a special way (not the same as 'subcreation' as a term in 
criticism of art, though I tried to show allegorically how that might come to be 
taken up into Creation in some plane in my 'purgatorial' story Leaf by Niggle 
(Dublin Review 1945)) to make visible and physical the effects of Sin or misused 
Free Will by men. Free Will is derivative, and is.'. only operative within 
provided circumstances; but in order that it may exist, it is necessary that the 
Author should guarantee it, whatever betides : sc. when it is 'against His 
Will', as we say, at any rate as it appears on a finite view. He does not stop 
or make 'unreal' sinful acts and their consequences. So in this myth, it is 
'feigned' (legitimately whether that is a feature of the real world or not) that 
He gave special 'sub-creative' powers to certain of His highest created beings: 
that is a guarantee that what they devised and made should be given the reality 
of Creation. Of course within limits, and of course subject to certain commands 
or prohibitions. But if they 'fell', as the Diabolus Morgoth did, and started 
making things 'for himself, to be their Lord', these would then 'be', even if 
Morgoth broke the supreme ban against making other 'rational' creatures like 
Elves or Men. They would at least 'be' real physical realities in the physical 
world, however evil they might prove, even 'mocking' the Children of God. They 
would be Morgoth's greatest Sins, abuses of his highest privilege, and would be 
creatures begotten of Sin, and naturally bad. (I nearly wrote 'irredeemably 
bad'; but that would be going too far. Because by accepting or tolerating their 
making necessary to their actual existence even Orcs would become part of the 
World, which is God's and ultimately good.) But whether they could have 'souls' 
or 'spirits' seems a different question; and since in my myth at any rate I do 
not conceive of the making of souls or spirits, things of an equal order if not 
an equal power to the Valar, as a possible 'delegation', I have represented at 
least the Orcs as pre-existing real beings on whom the Dark Lord has exerted the 
fullness of his power in remodelling and corrupting them, not making them. That 
God would 'tolerate' that, seems no worse theology than the toleration of the 
calculated dehumanizing of Men by tyrants that goes on today. There might be 
other 'makings' all the same which were more like puppets filled (only at a 
distance) with their maker's mind and will, or ant-like operating under 
direction of a queen-centre.

<BR>This /LotR/ is a tale about a war, and if war is allowed (at least as a topic and a 
setting) it is not much good complaining that all the people on one side are 
against those on the other. Not that I have made even this issue quite so 
simple: there are Saruman, and Denethor, and Boromir; and there are treacheries 
and strife even among the Orcs.

<BR>Denethor despised lesser men, and one may be sure did not distinguish 
between orcs and the allies of Mordor. If he had survived as victor, even 
without use of the Ring, he would have taken a long stride towards becoming 
himself a tyrant, and the terms and treatment he accorded to the deluded peoples 
of east and south would have been cruel and vengeful. He had become a 
'political' leader: sc. Gondor against the rest.
<BR>...In my story I do not deal 
in Absolute Evil. I do not think there is such a thing, since that is Zero. I do 
not think that at any rate any 'rational being' is wholly evil. Satan fell. In 
my myth Morgoth fell before Creation of the physical world. In my story Sauron 
represents as near an approach to the wholly evil will as is possible. He had 
gone the way of all tyrants: beginning well, at least on the level that while 
desiring to order all things according to his own wisdom he still at first 
considered the (economic) well-being of other inhabitants of the Earth. But he 
went further than human tyrants in pride and the lust for domination, being in 
origin an immortal (angelic) spirit*. In The Lord of the Rings the conflict is 
not basically about ‘freedom’, though that is naturally involved. It is about 
God, and His sole right to divine honour. The Eldar and the Numenoreans believed 
in The One, the true God, and held worship of any other person an abomination. 
Sauron desired to be a God-King, and was held to be this by his servants**; if 
he had been victorious he would have demanded divine honour from all rational 
creatures and absolute temporal power over the whole world. So even if in 
desperation 'the West' had bred or hired hordes of orcs and had cruelly ravaged 
the lands of other Men as allies of Sauron, or merely to prevent them from 
aiding him, their Cause would have remained indefeasibly right. As does the 
Cause of those who oppose now the State-God and Marshal This or That as its High 
Priest, even if it is true (as it unfortunately is) that many of their deeds are 
wrong, even if it were true (as it is not) that the inhabitants of 'The West', 
except for a minority of wealthy bosses, live in fear and squalor, while the 
worshippers of the State-God live in peace and abundance and in mutual esteem 
and trust.<BR>So I feel that the fiddle-faddle in reviews, and correspondence 
about them, as to whether my 'good people' were kind and merciful and gave 
quarter (in fact they do), or not, is quite beside the point. 
<P align=justify>*Of the same kind as Gandalf and Saruman, but of a far higher order.
<BR>**By a triple treachery: 1. Because of his admiration of Strength he had become a follower of 
Morgoth and fell with him down into the depths of evil, becoming his chief agent 
in Middle Earth. 2. when Morgoth was defeated by the Valar finally he forsook 
his allegiance; but out of fear only; he did not present himself to the Valar or 
sue for pardon, and remained in Middle Earth. 3. When he found how greatly his 
knowledge was admired by all other rational creatures and how easy it was to 
influence them, his pride became boundless. By the end of the Second Age he 
assumed the position of Morgoth's representative. By the end of the Third Age 
(though actually much weaker than before) he claimed to be Morgoth 
returned.

<BR>§ 19. Why does Z put beaks and feathers on Orcs!? (Orcs is not a form of Auks). The Orcs are definitely 
stated to be corruptions of the 'human' form seen in Elves and Men. They are (or

<BR>Letters. Letter 212.
<BR>I suppose a difference between this Myth and what may be perhaps called Christian mythology 
is this. In the latter the Fall of Man is subsequent to and a consequence 
(though not a necessary consequence) of the 'Fall of the Angels' : a rebellion 
of created free-will at a higher level than Man; but it is not clearly held (and 
in many versions is not held at all) that this affected the 'World' in its 
nature: evil was brought in from outside, by Satan. In this Myth the rebellion 
of created free-will precedes creation of the World (Ea); and Ea has in it, 
subcreatively introduced, evil, rebellions, discordant elements of its own 
nature already when the Let it Be was spoken. The Fall or corruption, therefore, 
of all things in it and all inhabitants of it, was a possibility if not 
inevitable. Trees may 'go bad' as in the Old Forest; Elves may turn into Orcs, 
and if this required the special perversive malice of Morgoth, still Elves 
themselves could do evil deeds. Even the 'good' Valar as inhabiting the World 
could at least err; as the Great Valar did in their dealings with the Elves; or 
as the lesser of their kind (as the Istari or wizards) could in various ways 
become self-seeking. Aule, for instance, one of the Great, in a sense 'fell'; 
for he so desired to see the Children, that he became impatient and tried to 
anticipate the will of the Creator. Being the greatest of all craftsmen he tried 
to make children according to his imperfect knowledge of their kind. When he had 
made thirteen, God spoke to him in anger, but not without pity: for Aule had 
done this thing not out of evil desire to have slaves and subjects of his own, 
but out of impatient love, desiring children to talk to and teach, sharing with 
them the praise of Iluvatar and his great love of the materials of which the 
world is made.
<BR>The One rebuked Aule, saying that he had tried to usurp the 
Creator's power; but he could not give independent life to his makings. He had 
only one life, his own derived from the One, and could at most only distribute 
it. 'Behold' said the One: 'these creatures of thine have only thy will, and thy 
movement. Though you have devised a language for them, they can only report to 
thee thine own thought. This is a mockery of me.'
<BR>Then Aule in grief and 
repentance humbled himself and asked for pardon. And he said: 'I will destroy 
these images of my presumption, and wait upon thy will.' And he took a great 
hammer, raising it to smite the eldest of his images; but it flinched and 
cowered from him. And as he withheld his stroke, astonished, he heard the 
laughter of Iluvatar.
<BR>'Do you wonder at this?' he said. 'Behold! thy creatures now live, free from thy will! For I have seen thy humility, and taken 
pity on your impatience. Thy making I have taken up into my design.'
<BR>This is the Elvish legend of the making of the Dwarves ; but the Elves report that 
Iluvatar said thus also: 'Nonetheless I will not suffer my design to be 
forestalled: thy children shall not awake before mine own.' And he commanded 
Aule to lay the fathers of the Dwarves severally in deep places, each with his 
mate, save Durin the eldest who had none. There they should sleep long, until 
Iluvatar bade them awake. Nonetheless there has been for the most part little 
love between the Dwarves and the children of Iluvatar. And of the fate that 
Iluvatar has set upon the children of Aule beyond the Circles of the world Elves 
and men know nothing, and if Dwarves know they do not speak of 
it.

<BR>[An account of Tolkien's unfinished story 'The New Shadow'. (See also no. 338.)]
<BR>I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the Downfall [of Mordor], but it proved both sinister and 
depressing. Since we are dealing with Men it is inevitable that we should be 
concerned with the most regrettable feature of their nature: their quick satiety 
with good. So that the people of Gondor in times of peace, justice and 
prosperity, would become discontented and restless, while the dynasts descended 
from Aragorn would become just kings and governors like Denethor or worse. I 
found that even so early there was an outcrop of revolutionary plots, about a 
centre of secret Satanistic religion; while Gondorian boys were playing at being 
Orcs and going round doing damage. I could have written a 'thriller' about the 
plot and its discovery and overthrow, but it would be just that. Not worth

<BR>[Answering the question: did the Ents ever find the Entwives?]
<BR>As for the Entwives: I do not know. I have 
written nothing beyond the first few years of the Fourth Age. (Except the 
beginning of a tale supposed to refer to the end of the reign of Eldaron about 
100 years after the death of Aragorn. Then I of course discovered that the 
King's Peace would contain no tales worth recounting; and his wars would have 
little interest after the overthrow of Sauron; but that almost certainly a 
restlessness would appear about then, owing to the (it seems) inevitable boredom 
of Men with the good: there would be secret societies practising dark cults, and 
'orc-cults' among adolescents.) But I think in Vol. II pp. 80-81 it is plain 
that there would be for Ents no re-union in 'history', but Ents and their wives 
being rational creatures would find some 'earthly paradise' until the end of 
this world: beyond which the wisdom neither of Elves nor Ents could see. Though 
maybe they shared the hope of Aragorn that they were 'not bound for ever to the 
circles of the world and beyond them is more than

were lying, and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields

<BR>LotR. 3:1. The Departure of Boromir. 
<BR>Quickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and 
shields into a heap. 'See!' cried Aragorn. 'Here we find tokens!' He picked out 
from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; 
and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 
'No orc-tools these!' he said. 'They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the 
Orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they 
are: work of Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, 
now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things, 
hoping against hope, to give them back.'
<BR>'And I,' said Legolas, 'will take 
all the arrows that I can find, for my quiver is empty.' He searched in the pile 
and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in 
the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them 
closely.
<BR>And Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here lie many that 
are not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I 
know anything of Orcs and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. Their 
gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!'
<BR>There were four goblin-soldiers 
of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They 
were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual 
with Orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. 
Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre 
of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of 
some white metal.
<BR>'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. 'What 
do they mean?'
<BR>'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to 
read.'
<BR>'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.'
<BR>'Neither 
does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said Aragorn. 
'And he does not use white. The Orcs in the service of Barad-dur use the sign of 
the Red Eye.' He stood for a moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman, I guess,' he 
said at length. 'There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer 
safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of 
our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's fall. Pursuers from 
Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lorien, or they may have avoided that 
land and come to Isengard by other paths. Orcs travel 
fast.

<BR>'I think that the

Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange 
badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul 
folk. Maybe there was some dispute about the road.'
<BR>'Light feet may run 
swiftly here,' said Aragorn. 'More swiftly, maybe, than iron-shod Orcs. Now we 
have a chance to lessen their lead!'
<BR>They went in single file, running like 
hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west 
the broad swath of the marching Orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of 
Rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed.
<BR>'Surely even Orcs must 
pause on the march?' said Gimli. 'Seldom will Orcs journey in the open under the 
sun. yet these have done so,' said Legolas. 'Certainly they will not rest by 
night.'

<BR>'Then you do not pay 
tribute to Sauron?' said Gimli.
<BR>'We do not and we never have.' said Йomer 
with a flash of his eyes; 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been 
told. Some years ago the Lord of the Black Land wished to purchase horses of us 
at great price, but we refused him, for he puts beasts to evil use. Then he sent 
plundering Orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black 
horses: few of these are now left. For that reason our feud with the Orcs is 
bitter.
<BR>'But at this time our chief concern is with Saruman. He has claimed 
lordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for many months. 
He has taken Orcs into his service, and Wolf-riders, and evil Men, and he has 
closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both east and 
west.
<BR>'Indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave, for in my 
absence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the 
orc-host coming down out of the East Wall three nights ago, and among them they 
reported that some bore the white badges of Saruman. So suspecting what I most 
fear, a league between Orthanc and the Dark Tower, I led forth my eored, men of 
my own household; and we overtook the Orcs at nightfall two days ago, near to 
the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and gave battle yesterday 
at dawn. Fifteen of my men I lost, and twelve horses alas! For the Orcs were 
greater in number than we counted on. Others joined them, coming out of the East 
across the Great River: their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot. 
And others, too, came out of the forest. Great Orcs, who also bore the White 
Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all

<BR>At last as the 
afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade 
among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were 
still hot and smoking. Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven 
shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake 
in the middle was set a great goblin head; upon its shattered helm the white 
badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the river, where it came 
streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: 
the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen 
spears.

<BR>They had run a long way 
shouting--he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had 
crashed right into a group of Orcs: they were standing listening, and they did 
not appear to see Merry and Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then 
they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. Merry and 
he had drawn their swords, but the Orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried 
only to lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several of their arms and 
hands. Good old Merry! 
<BR>/.../ 
<BR>He struggled a little, quite uselessly. One 
of the Orcs sitting near laughed and said something to a companion in their 
abominable tongue. 'Rest while you can, little fool!' he said then to Pippin, in 
the Common Speech, which he made almost as hideous as his own language. 'Rest 
while you can! We'll find a use for your legs before long. You'll wish you had 
got none before we get home.'
<BR>'If I had my way, you'd wish you were dead 
now,' said the other. 'I'd make you squeak, you miserable rat.' He stooped over 
Pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a 
long jagged blade in his hand. 'Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this,' he 
hissed. 'Don't draw attention to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the 
Isengarders! Ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob bubhosh skai': he passed 
into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering 
and snarling.
<BR>Terrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and 
ankles was growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. To 
take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. There 
were many voices round about, and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of 
hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was 
getting hotter.
<BR>To Pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was 
intelligible many of the Orcs were using ordinary language. Apparently the 
members of two or three quite different tribes were present, and they could not 
understand one another's orc-speech. There was an angry debate concerning what 
they were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with 
the prisoners.
<BR>'There's no time to kill them properly,' said one. 'No time 
for play on this trip.'
<BR>'That can't be helped,' said another. 'But why not 
kill them quick, kill them now? They're a cursed nuisance, and we're in a hurry. 
Evening's coming on, and we ought to get a move on.'
<BR>'Orders.' said a third 
voice in a deep growl. 'Kill all but NOT the Halfings; they are to be brought 
back ALIVE as quickly as possible. That's my orders.'
<BR>'What are they wanted 
for?' asked several voices. 'Why alive? Do they give good sport?'
<BR>'No! I 
heard that one of them has got something, something that's wanted for the War, 
some elvish plot or other. Anyway they'll both be questioned.'
<BR>'Is that all 
you know? Why don't we search them and find out? We might find something that we 
could use ourselves.'
<BR>'That is a very interesting remark,' sneered a voice, 
softer than the others but more evil. 'I may have to report that. The prisoners 
are NOT to be searched or plundered: those are my orders.'
<BR>'And mine too,' 
said the deep voice. 'Alive and as captured; no spoiling. That's my 
orders.'
<BR>'Not our orders!' said one of the earlier voices. 'We have come all 
the way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go 
back north.'
<BR>'Then you can wish again,' said the growling voice. 'I am Ugluk. 
I command. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.'
<BR>'Is Saruman the master 
or the Great Eye?' said the evil voice. 'We should go back at once to 
Lugburz.'
<BR>'If we could cross the Great River, we might,' said another voice. 
'But there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.'
<BR>'I came 
across,' said the evil voice. 'A winged Nazgul awaits us northward on the 
east-bank.'
<BR>'Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get 
all the pay and praise in Lugburz, and leave us to foot it as best we can 
through the Horse-country. No, we must stick together. These lands are 
dangerous: full of foul rebels and brigands.'
<BR>'Aye, we must stick together,' 
growled Ugluk. 'I don't trust you little swine. You've no guts outside your own 
sties. But for us you'd all have run away. We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We slew 
the great warrior. We took the prisoners. We are the servants of Saruman the 
Wise, the White Hand: the Hand that gives us man's-flesh to eat. We came out of 
Isengard, and led you here, and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I 
am Ugluk. I have spoken.'
<BR>'You have spoken more than enough, Ugluk,' sneered 
the evil voice. 'I wonder how they would like it in Lugburz. They might think 
that Ugluk's shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. They might ask where 
his strange ideas came from. Did they come from Saruman, perhaps? Who does he 
think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white badges? They might 
agree with me, with Grishnakh their trusted messenger; and I Grishnakh say this: 
Saruman is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great Eye is on 
him.
<BR>'Swine is it? How do you folk like being called swine by the muck-rakers 
of a dirty little wizard? It's orc-flesh they eat, I'll warrant.'
<BR>Many loud 
yells in orc-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of weapons being drawn. 
Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. His guards had 
gone to join in the fray. In the twilight he saw a large black Orc, probably 
Ugluk, standing facing Grishnakh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and 
with long arms that hung almost to the ground. Round them were many smaller 
goblins. Pippin supposed that these were the ones from the North. They had drawn 
their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack Ugluk.
<BR>Ugluk shouted, and a 
number of other Orcs of nearly his own size ran up. Then suddenly, without 
warning, Ugluk sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off 
two of his opponents. Grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. The 
others gave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over Merry's prostrate form 
with a curse. Yet that probably saved his life, for Ugluk's followers leaped 
over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the 
yellow-fanged guard. His body fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its 
long saw-edged knife.
<BR>'Put up your weapons!' shouted Ugluk. 'And let's have 
no more nonsense! We go straight west from here, and down the stair. From there 
straight to the downs, then along the river to the forest. And we march day and 
night. That clear?'
<BR>'Now,' thought Pippin, 'if only it takes that ugly fellow 
a little while to get his troop under control, I've got a chance.' A gleam of 
hope had come to him. The edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then 
slid down to his wrist. He felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he also 
felt the cold touch of steel against his skin.
<BR>The Orcs were getting ready to 
march again, but some of the Northerners were still unwilling, and the 
Isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed. There was much cursing and 
confusion. For the moment Pippin was unwatched. His legs were securely bound, 
but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands were in front of 
him. He could move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He 
pushed the dead Orc to one side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot 
of the wrist-cord up and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and 
the dead hand held it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his 
fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it 
over his hands. Then he lay very still.
<BR>/.../
<BR>'Pick up those prisoners!' 
shouted Ugluk. 'Don't play any tricks with them! If they are not alive when we 
get back, someone else will die too.'
<BR>An Orc seized Pippin like a sack. put 
its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until 
Pippin's face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with him. Another 
treated Merry in the same way. The Orc's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms 
like iron; the nails bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil 
dreams.
<BR>Suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early 
night, but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edge of 
a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of 
water falling nearby.
<BR>'The scouts have come back at last,' said an Orc close 
at hand.
<BR>'Well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of Ugluk.
<BR>'Only 
a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.'
<BR>'Now, I 
daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot him. He'll raise the 
alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. Now we'll have to 
leg it double quick.'
<BR>A shadow bent over Pippin. It was Ugluk. 'Sit up!' said 
the Orc. 'My lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and 
you must use your legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying to escape. We 
have ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your 
usefulness for the Master.'
<BR>He cut the thongs round Pippin's legs and ankles, 
picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet. Pippin fell down, and Ugluk 
dragged him up by his hair again. Several Orcs laughed. Ugluk thrust a flask 
between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot 
fierce glow flow through him. The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could 
stand.
<BR>'Now for the other!' said Ugluk. Pippin saw him go to Merry, who was 
lying close by, and kick him. Merry groaned. Seizing him roughly Ugluk pulled 
him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then he smeared 
the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. Merry cried out and 
struggled wildly.
<BR>The Orcs clapped and hooted. 'Can't take his medicine,' 
they jeered. 'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun 
later.'
<BR>But at the moment Ugluk was not engaged in sport. He needed speed and 
had to humour unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in orc-fashion; and his 
treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a drink from his flask down the 
hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, Merry stood up, 
looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. The gash in his forehead 
gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the end of his 
days.
<BR>'Hullo, Pippin!' he said. 'So you've come on this little expedition, 
too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?'
<BR>'Now then!' said Ugluk. 'None of 
that! Hold your tongues. No talk to one another. Any trouble will be reported at 
the other end, and He'll know how to pay you. You'll get bed and breakfast all 
right: more than you can stomach.'
<BR>/.../
<BR>The orc-band began to descend a 
narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. Merry and Pippin, 
separated by a dozen Orcs or more, climbed down with them. At the bottom they 
stepped on to grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.
<BR>'Now straight on!' 
shouted Ugluk. 'West and a little north. Follow Lugdush.'
<BR>'But what are we 
going to do at sunrise?' said some of the Northerners.
<BR>'Go on running,' said 
Ugluk. 'What do you think? Sit on the grass and wait for the Whiteskins to join 
the picnic?'
<BR>'But we can't run in the sunlight.'
<BR>'You'll run with me 
behind you,' said Ugluk. 'Run! Or you'll never see your beloved holes again. By 
the White Hand! What's the use of sending out mountain-maggots on a trip, only 
half trained. Run, curse you! Run while night lasts!'
<BR>Then the whole company 
began to run with the long loping strides of Orcs. They kept no order, 
thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed was very great. Each hobbit 
had a guard of three. Pippin was far back in the line. He wondered how long he 
would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. One 
of his guards had a whip. But at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. 
His wits, too, were wide-awake.
<BR>Every now and again there came into his mind 
unbidden a vision of the keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and 
running, running behind. But what could even a Ranger see except a confused 
trail of orc-feet? His own little prints and Merry's were overwhelmed by the 
trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about 
them.
<BR>They had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped 
down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist lay 
there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. The dark shapes of 
the Orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.
<BR>'Ai! Steady now!' 
shouted Ugluk from the rear.
<BR>A sudden thought leaped into Pippin's mind, and 
he acted on it at once. He swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the 
reach of his clutching guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on 
the grass.
<BR>'Halt!' yelled Ugluk.
<BR>There was for a moment turmoil and 
confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran. But the Orcs were after him. Some suddenly 
loomed up right in front of him.
<BR>'No hope of escape!' thought Pippin. 'But 
there is a hope that I have left some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet 
ground.' He groped with his two tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the 
brooch of his cloak. Just as long arms and hard claws seized him. he let it 
fall. 'There I suppose it will lie until the end of time,' he thought. 'I don't 
know why I did it. If the others have escaped, they've probably all gone with 
Frodo.'
<BR>A whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.
<BR>'Enough!' shouted Ugluk running up. 'He's still got to run a long way 
yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.'
<BR>'But that's not all,' he snarled, turning to Pippin. 'I shan't forget. Payment is only put off. 
Leg it!'
<BR>/.../
<BR>Neither Pippin nor Merry remembered much of the later part 
of the journey. Evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of 
misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. They ran, and they ran, striving 
to keep up the pace set by the Orcs, licked every now and again with a cruel 
thong cunningly handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were seized and 
dragged for some distance.
<BR>The warmth of the orc-draught had gone. Pippin 
felt cold and sick again. Suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands 
with rending nails gripped and lifted him. He was carried like a sack once more, 
and darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of another night, or a 
blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.
<BR>Dimly he became aware of voices 
clamouring: it seemed that many of the Orcs were demanding a halt. Ugluk was 
shouting. He felt himself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till black 
dreams took him. But he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron grip of 
merciless hands was on him again. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and 
then slowly the darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and 
found that it was morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the 
grass.
<BR>There he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but 
from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught. An 
Orc stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh. 
He ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not the meat. He was famished but not 
yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Orc, the flesh of he dared 
not guess what creature.
<BR>He sat up and looked about. Merry was not far away. 
They were by the banks of a swift narrow river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall 
peak was catching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the 
lower slopes before them.
<BR>There was much shouting and debating among the 
Orcs; a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the 
Northerners and the Isengarders. Some were pointing back away south, and some 
were pointing eastward.
<BR>'Very well,' said Ugluk. 'Leave them to me then! No 
killing, as I've told you before; but if you want to throw away what we've come 
all the way to get, throw it away! I'll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai 
do the work, as usual. If you're afraid of the Whiteskins, run! Run! There's the 
forest,' he shouted, pointing ahead. 'Get to it! It's your best hope. Off you 
go! And quick, before I knock a few more heads off, to put some sense into the 
others.'
<BR>There was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the 
Northerners broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly 
along the river towards the mountains. The hobbits were left with the 
Isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least of large, swart, slant-eyed 
Orcs with great bows and short broad-bladed swords. A few of the larger and 
bolder Northerners remained with them.
<BR>'Now we'll deal with Grishnakh,' said 
Ugluk; but some even of his own followers were looking uneasily 
southwards.
<BR>'I know,' growled Ugluk. 'The cursed horse-boys have got wind of 
us. But that's all your fault, Snaga. You and the other scouts ought to have 
your ears cut off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast on horseflesh yet, or 
something better.'
<BR>At that moment Pippin saw why some of the troop had been 
pointing eastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries, and there 
was Grishnakh again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: 
long-armed crook-legged Orcs. They had a red eye painted on their shields. Ugluk 
stepped forward to meet them. 'So you've come back?' he said. 'Thought better of 
it, eh?'
<BR>'I've returned to see that Orders are carried out and the prisoners 
safe,' answered Grishnakh.
<BR>'Indeed!' said Ugluk. 'Waste of effort. I'll see 
that orders are carried out in my command. And what else did you come back for? 
You went in a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?'
<BR>'I left a fool,' snarled 
Grishnakh. 'But there were some stout fellows with him that are too good to 
lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've come to help 
them.'
<BR>'Splendid!' laughed Ugluk. 'But unless you've got some guts for 
fighting, you've taken the wrong way. Lugburz was your road. The Whiteskins are 
coming. What's happened to your precious Nazgul? Has he had another mount shot 
under him? Now, if you'd brought him along, that might have been useful-if these 
Nazgul are all they make out.'
<BR>'Nazgul, Nazgul,' said Grishnakh, shivering 
and licking his lips, as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured 
painfully. 'You speak of what is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, 
Ugluk,' he said. 'Nazgul! Ah! All that they make out! One day you'll wish that 
you had not said that. Ape!' he snarled fiercely. 'You ought to know that 
they're the apple of the Great Eye. But the winged Nazgul: not yet, not yet. He 
won't let them show themselves across the Great River yet, not too soon. They're 
for the War-and other purposes.'
<BR>'You seem to know a lot,' said Ugluk. 'More 
than is good for you, I guess. Perhaps those in Lugburz might wonder how, and 
why. But in the meantime the Uruk-hai of Isengard can do the dirty work, as 
usual. Don't stand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The other swine 
are legging it to the forest. You'd better follow. You wouldn't get back to the 
Great River alive. Right off the mark! Now! I'll be on your 
heels.'
<BR>/.../
<BR>The Isengarders seized Merry and Pippin again and slung them 
on their backs. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing 
now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. Either because they 
were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of Grishnakh's, the 
Isengarders gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor, and Grishnakh's folk 
closed in behind. Soon they were gaining also on the Northerners ahead. The 
forest began to draw nearer.
<BR>Pippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was 
grated by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the Orc that held him. Immediately in 
front were bowed backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, 
unresting, as if they were made of wire and horn, beating out the nightmare 
seconds of an endless time.
<BR>In the afternoon Ugluk's troop overtook the 
Northerners. They were flagging in the rays of the bright sun, winter sun 
shining in a pale cool sky though it was; their heads were down and their 
tongues lolling out.
<BR>'Maggots!' jeered the Isengarders. 'You're cooked. The 
Whiteskins will catch you and eat you. They're coming!'
<BR>A cry from Grishnakh 
showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen, riding very swiftly, had indeed 
been sighted: still far behind, but gaining on the Orcs, gaining on them like a 
tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand.
<BR>The Isengarders began to 
run with a redoubled pace that astonished Pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for 
the end of a race. Then he saw that the sun was sinking, falling behind the 
Misty Mountains; shadows reached over the land. The soldiers of Mordor lifted 
their heads and also began to put on speed. The forest was dark and close. 
Already they had passed a few outlying trees. The land was beginning to slope 
upwards. ever more steeply; but the Orcs did not halt. Both Ugluk and Grishnakh 
shouted, spurring them on to a last effort.
<BR>/.../
<BR>'They will make it yet. 
They will escape,' thought Pippin. And then he managed to twist his neck. so as 
to glance back with one eye over his shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward 
were already level with the Orcs, galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded 
their spears and helmets, and glinted in their pale flowing hair. They were 
hemming the Orcs in, preventing them from scattering, and driving them along the 
line of the river.
<BR>He wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He 
wished now that he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and 
things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more 
competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or 
from Strider, and even from Frodo. All that he could remember about Rohan was 
that Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax, had come from that land. That sounded hopeful, 
as far as it went.
<BR>'But how will they know that we are not Orcs?' he thought. 
'I don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. I suppose I ought to 
be glad that the beastly Orcs look like being destroyed, but I would rather be 
saved myself.' The chances were that he and Merry would be killed together with 
their captors, before ever the Men of Rohan were aware of them.<BR>A few of the 
riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a running horse. Riding 
swiftly into range they shot arrows at the Orcs that straggled behind, and 
several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out of the range of the 
answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not daring to halt. This 
happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell among the Isengarders. One 
of them, just in front of Pippin, stumbled and did not get up 
again.
<BR>/.../
<BR>Night came down without the Riders closing in for battle. 
Many Orcs had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness the 
Orcs came to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably no more 
than three furlongs away, but they could go no further. The horsemen had 
encircled them. A small band disobeyed Ugluk's command, and ran on towards the 
forest: only three returned.
<BR>'Well, here we are,' sneered Grishnakh. 'Fine 
leadership! I hope the great Ugluk will lead us out again.'
<BR>'Put those 
Halflings down!' ordered Ugluk, taking no notice of Grishnakh. 'You, Lugdush, 
get two others and stand guard over them! They're not to be killed, unless the 
filthy Whiteskins break through. Understand? As long as I'm alive, I want 'em. 
But they're not to cry out, and they're not to be rescued. Bind their 
legs!'<BR>The last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pippin 
found that for the first time he was close to Merry. The Orcs were making a 
great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits 
managed to whisper together for a while.<BR>'I don't think much of this,' said 
Merry. 'I feel nearly done in. Don't think I could crawl away far, even if I was 
free.'<BR>'Lembas!' whispered Pippin. 'Lembas: I've got some. Have you? I don't 
think they've taken anything but our swords.'<BR>'Yes, I had a packet in my 
pocket,' answered Merry, 'but it must be battered to crumbs. Anyway I can't put 
my mouth in my pocket!'<BR>'You won't have to. I've—'; but just then a savage 
kick warned Pippin that the noise had died down, and the guards were 
watchful.<BR>/.../<BR>The night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which 
the Orcs were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, 
a complete ring of them. They were within a long bowshot. but the riders did not 
show themselves against the light, and the Orcs wasted many arrows shooting at 
the fires, until Ugluk stopped them. The riders made no sound. Later in the 
night when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally they could be seen, 
shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white light, as they moved in 
ceaseless patrol.<BR>'They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!' growled one of the 
guards. 'Why don't we get together and charge through? What's old Ugluk think 
he's doing, I should like to know?'<BR>'I daresay you would,' snarled Ugluk 
stepping up from behind. 'Meaning I don't think at all, eh? Curse you! You're as 
bad as the other rabble: the maggots and the apes of Lugburz. No good trying to 
charge with them. They'd just squeal and bolt, and there are more than enough of 
these filthy horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat.<BR>'There's only one 
thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets in the dark. But these 
Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from all I've heard; and don't 
forget their horses! They can see the night-breeze, or so it's said. Still 
there's one thing the fine fellows don't know: Mauhur and his lads are in the 
forest, and they should turn up any time now.'<BR>Ugluk's words were enough, 
apparently, to satisfy the Isengarders; but the other Orcs were both dispirited 
and rebellious. They posted a few watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, 
resting in the pleasant darkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the 
moon passed westward into thick cloud, and Pippin could not see anything a few 
feet away. The fires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, 
however, content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A 
sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. It 
seemed that some of the Men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, 
crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several Orcs, and then had faded away 
again. Ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede.<BR>Pippin and Merry sat up. Their 
guards, Isengarders, had gone with Ugluk. But if the hobbits had any thought of 
escape, it was soon dashed. A long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and 
drew them close together. Dimly they were aware of Grishnakh's great head and 
hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. He began to paw 
them and feel them. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his 
back.<BR>'Well, my little ones!' said Grishnakh in a soft whisper. 'Enjoying 
your nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips on 
one side, and nasty spears on the other! Little people should not meddle in 
affairs that are too big for them.' His fingers continued to grope. There was a 
light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.<BR>The thought came suddenly 
into Pippin's mind, as if caught direct from the urgent thought of his enemy: 
'Grishnakh knows about the Ring! He's looking for it, while Ugluk is busy: he 
probably wants it for himself.' Cold fear was in Pippin's heart, yet at the same 
time he was wondering what use he could make of Grishnakh's desire.<BR>'I don't 
think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'It isn't easy to 
find.'<BR>'Find it?' said Grishnakh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped 
Pippin's shoulder. 'Find what? What are you talking about, little one?'. For a 
moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his 
throat: gollum, gollum. 'Nothing, my precious,' he added.<BR>The hobbits felt 
Grishnakh's fingers twitch. 'O ho!' hissed the goblin softly. 'That's what he 
means, is it? O ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little ones.'<BR>'Perhaps,' said 
Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin's guess. 'Perhaps; and not only for us. 
Still you know your own business best. Do you want it, or not? And what would 
you give for it?'<BR>'Do I want it? Do I want it?' said Grishnakh, as if 
puzzled; but his arms were trembling. 'What would I give for it? What do you 
mean?'<BR>'We mean,' said Pippin, choosing his words carefully, 'that it's no 
good groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But you must untie 
our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.'<BR>'My dear tender little 
fools,' hissed Grishnakh, 'everything you have, and everything you know, will be 
got out of you in due time: everything! You'll wish there was more that you 
could tell to satisfy the Questioner, indeed you will: quite soon. We shan't 
hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no! What do you think you've been kept alive for? My 
dear little fellows, please believe me when I say that it was not out of 
kindness: that's not even one of Ugluk's faults.'<BR>'I find it quite easy to 
believe,' said Merry. 'But you haven't got your prey home yet. And it doesn't 
seem to be going your way, whatever happens. If we come to Isengard, it won't be 
the great Grishnakh that benefits: Saruman will take all that he can find. If 
you want anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal.'<BR>Grishnakh began 
to lose his temper. The name of Saruman seemed specially to enrage him. Time was 
passing and the disturbance was dying down. Ugluk or the Isengarders might 
return at any minute.<BR>'Have you got it – either of you?' he 
snarled.<BR>'Gollum, gollum!' said Pippin.<BR>'Untie our legs!' said 
Merry.<BR>They felt the Orc's arms trembling violently. 'Curse you, you filthy 
little vermin!' he hissed. 'Untie your legs? I'll untie every string in your 
bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the bones? Search you! I'll cut you 
both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help of your legs to get you away-and 
have you all to myself!'<BR>Suddenly he seized them. The strength in his long 
arms and shoulders was terrifying. He tucked them one under each armpit, and 
crushed them fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped over each 
of their mouths. Then he sprang forward, stooping low. Quickly and silently he 
went, until he came to the edge of the knoll. There, choosing a gap between the 
watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the night, down the slope and 
away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that direction 
there was a wide open space with only one fire.<BR>After going a dozen yards he 
halted, peering and listening. Nothing could be seen or heard. He crept slowly 
on, bent almost double. Then he squatted and listened again. Then he stood up, 
as if to risk a sudden dash. At that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed 
up right in front of him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called 
out.<BR>Grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits under 
him; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather than 
allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it was his undoing. The sword rang 
faintly, and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to his left. An 
arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, or guided by 
fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dropped the sword and shrieked. There 
was a quick beat of hoofs, and even as Grishnakh leaped up and ran, he was 
ridden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a hideous shivering cry and 
lay still.
<P align=justify>The hobbits remained flat on the ground, as Grishnakh had left 
them. Another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's aid. Whether because 
of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse 
lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying 
covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to 
move.<BR>/.../<BR>At last Merry stirred and whispered softly: 'So far so good: 
but how are we to avoid being spitted?'
<BR>The answer came almost immediately. 
The cries of Grishnakh had roused the Orcs. From the yells and screeches that 
came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been 
discovered: Ugluk was probably knocking off a few more heads. Then suddenly the 
answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, outside the circle of 
watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauhur had 
apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers. There was the sound of 
galloping horses. The Riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, 
risking the orc-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to 
deal with the newcomers. Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized that without moving 
they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape. 
/.../ Pippin was the first to come back to the present.<BR>'We must be off,' he 
said. 'Half a moment!' Grishnakh's sword was lying close at hand, but it was too 
heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled forward, and finding the body of 
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife. With this he quickly cut 
their bonds.<BR>'Now for it!' he said. 'When we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we 
shall be able to stand again, and walk. But in any case we had better start by 
crawling.'<BR>They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped 
them: but it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide berth, 
and wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the 
river, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. Then they looked 
back.<BR>The sounds had died away. Evidently Mauhur and his 'lads' had been 
killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. It 
would not last very much longer. Already the night was old. In the East, which 
had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.<BR>'We must get 
under cover,' said Pippin, 'or we shall be seen. It will not be any comfort to 
us, if these riders discover that we are not Orcs after we are dead.' He got up 
and stamped his feet. 'Those cords have cut me like wires; but my feet are 
getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What about you, Merry?' /They decide 
to escape from Rohirrim to the Forest/. <BR>/.../<BR>Far over the Great River, 
and the Brown Lands, leagues upon grey leagues away, the Dawn came, red as 
flame. Loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it. The Riders of Rohan sprang 
suddenly to life. Horn answered horn again.<BR>Merry and Pippin heard, clear in 
the cold air, the neighing of war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. 
The Sun's limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. Then 
with a great cry the Riders charged from the East; the red light gleamed on mail 
and spear. The Orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. The 
hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over 
it, and wheeled round and charged again. Most of the raiders that were left 
alive then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. 
But one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the 
direction of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards the 
watchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would 
escape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way.<BR>'We 
have watched too long,' said Merry. 'There's Ugluk! I don't want to meet him 
again.' The hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood.<BR>So it 
was that they did not sec the last stand, when Ugluk was overtaken and brought 
to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain at last by Йomer, the 
Third Marshal of the Mark, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. And 
over the wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted down the few Orcs that had 
escaped and still had strength to fly.<BR>Then when they had laid their fallen 
comrades in a mound and had sung their praises, the Riders made a great fire and 
scattered the ashes of their enemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came 
ever back either to Mordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of the burning rose 
high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes.

<BR>'Here at last we find 
news!' said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf for them to see, a large pale 
leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning brown. 'Here is a mallorn-leaf of 
Lуrien, and there are small crumbs on it, and a few more crumbs in the grass. 
And see! there are some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!'<BR>'And here is the 
knife that cut them!' said Gimli. He stooped and drew out of a tussock, into 
which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged blade. The haft from which 
it had been snapped was beside it. 'It was an orc-weapon,' he said, holding it 
gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like 
a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.<BR>They did not seek out 
the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed 
towards Isengard. Did they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his 
faithful comrade? I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain 
orders to Orcs, even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak 
openly to them of the Ring: they are not trusty servants. But I think the Orcs 
had been commanded to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made 
to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle. Treachery perhaps, 
likely enough with such folk; some large and bold Orc may have been trying to 
escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. There, that is my

<BR>Behind them orc-archers 
crowded, sending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls. They gained 
the gates. The trees, swung by strong arms, smote the timbers with a rending 
boom. If any man fell, crushed by a stone hurtling from above, two others sprang 
to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and 
crashed.

<BR>At last Aragorn stood above 
the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. As he looked forth he saw 
the eastern sky grow pale. Then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token 
of parley.
<BR>The Orcs yelled and jeered. 'Come down! Come down!' they cried. 
'If you wish to speak to us, come down! Bring out your king! We are the fighting 
Uruk-hai. We will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. Bring out your 
skulking king!'<BR>'The king stays or comes at his own will,' said 
Aragorn.<BR>'Then what are you doing here?' they answered. 'Why do you look out? 
Do you wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting 
Uruk-hai.'<BR>'I looked out to see the dawn,' said Aragorn.<BR>'What of the 
dawn?' they jeered. 'We are the Uruk-hai: we do not stop the fight for night or 
day, for fair weather or for storm. We come to kill, by sun or moon. What of the 
dawn?'<BR>'None knows what the new day shall bring him,' said Aragorn. 'Get you 
gone, ere it turn to your evil.'<BR>'Get down or we will shoot you from the 
wall,' they cried. 'This is no parley. You have nothing to say.' /The Orcs have 
respect to parley!/<BR>'I have still this to say,' answered Aragorn. 'No enemy 
has yet taken the Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not one 
will be left alive to take back tidings to the North. You do not know your 
peril.'<BR>So great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood 
there alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of 
the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and 
some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs laughed with loud voices; and 
a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as Aragorn leaped 
down.<BR>There was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above 
which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust. The 
barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. Aragorn ran to the king's 
tower.

could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his 
ears.<BR>'Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? 
'<BR>'Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking up 
there? Thinking of coming down to fight? '<BR>'Orders to you. I'm in command of 
this pass. So speak civil. What's your report? '<BR>'Nothing.'<BR>`Hai! hai!

suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the others.<BR>`Hai! Hola! 
Here's something! Lying right in the road. A spy, a spy! ' There was a hoot of 
snarling horns and a babel of baying voices. /.../<BR>There was a wild clamour, 
hooting and laughing, as something was lifted from the ground. 'Ya hoi! Ya harri 
hoi! Up! Up! '<BR>Then a voice shouted: `Now off! The quick way. Back to the 
Undergate! She'll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.' The whole band of 
orc-figures began to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on their 
shoulders. `Ya hoi! ' /../<BR>/Orcs/ gabbled and yammered after the fashion of 
their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead 
air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were 
louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing 
up the rear, debating as they went.<BR>'Can't you stop your rabble making such a 
racket, Shagrat? ' grunted the one. `We don't want Shelob on us.'<BR>`Go on, 
Gorbag! Yours are making more than half the noise,' said the other. `But let the 
lads play! No need to worry about Shelob for a bit, I reckon. She's sat on a 
nail, it seems, and we shan't cry about that. Didn't you see: a nasty mess all 
the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If we've stopped it once, we've 
stopped it a hundred times. So let 'em laugh. And we've struck a bit of luck at 
last: got something that Lugburz wants.'<BR>'Lugburz wants it, eh? What is it, 
d'you think? Elvish it looked to me, but undersized. What's the danger in a 
thing like that? '<BR>'Don't know till we've had a look.'<BR>'Oho! So they 
haven't told you what to expect? They don't tell us all they know, do they? Not 
by half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top Ones can.'<BR>`Sh, Gorbag!' 
Shagrat's voice was lowered, so that even with his strangely sharpened hearing 
Sam could only just catch what was said. 'They may, but they've got eyes and 
ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as not. But there's no doubt about 
it, they're troubled about something. The Nazgul down below are, by your 
account; and Lugburz is too. Something nearly slipped.'<BR>`Nearly, you say! ' 
said Gorbag.<BR>`All right,' said Shagrat, `but we'll talk of that later: Wait 
till we get to the Under-way. There's a place there where we can talk a bit, 
while the lads go on.'<BR>Shortly afterwards Sam saw the torches disappear. Then 
there was a rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as he 
could guess the Orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo and 
he had tried and found blocked. It was still blocked.<BR>There seemed to be a 
great stone in the way, but the Orcs had got through somehow, for he could hear 
their voices on the other side. They were still running along, deeper and deeper 
into the mountain, back towards the tower. Sam felt desperate. They were 
carrying off his master's body for some foul purpose and he could not follow. He 
thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himself against it, but it did not 
yield. Then not far inside, or so he thought, he heard the two captains' voices 
talking again. He stood still listening for a little hoping perhaps to learn 
something useful. Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would 
come out, and he could then slip in.<BR>`No, I don't know,' said Gorbag's voice. 
`The messages go through quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I don't 
enquire how it's done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgul give me the creeps. And 
they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the 
dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favourites nowadays, so 
it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the 
city.'<BR>`You should try being up here with Shelob for company,' said 
Shagrat.<BR>'I'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em. But the war's 
on now, and when that's over things may be easier.'<BR>`It's going well, they 
say.'<BR>'They would.' grunted Gorbag. `We'll see. But anyway, if it does go 
well, there should be a lot more room. What d'you say? – if we get a chance, you 
and me'll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, 
somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.'<BR>'Ah! ' 
said Shagrat. `Like old times.'<BR>`Yes,' said Gorbag. 'But don't count on it. 
I'm not easy in my mind. As I said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice sank almost 
to a whisper, `ay, even the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped 
you say. I say, something has slipped. And we've got to look out. Always the 
poor Uruks to put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies 
don't love us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, 
we're done too. But see here: when were you ordered out? '<BR>`About an hour 
ago, just before you saw us. A message came: Nazgul uneasy. Spies feared on 
Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs. I came at once.'<BR>'Bad 
business,' said Gorbag. `See here – our Silent Watchers were uneasy more than 
two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out for another day, nor 
any message sent to Lugburz either: owing to the Great Signal going up, and the 
High Nazgul going off to the war, and all that. And then they couldn't get 
Lugburz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.'<BR>`The Eye was busy 
elsewhere, I suppose,' said Shagrat. `Big things going on away west, they 
say.'<BR>'I daresay,' growled Gorbag. `But in the meantime enemies have got up 
the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're supposed to keep watch, aren't you, 
special orders or no? What are you for?'<BR>`That's enough! Don't try and teach 
me my job. We were awake all right. We knew there were funny things going 
on.'<BR>`Very funny! '<BR>`Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But 
Shelob was on the go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.'<BR>`Her Sneak? What's 
that? '<BR>`You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider 
himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He's been here before. Came out of 
Lugburz the first time, years ago, and we had word from High Up to let him pass. 
He's been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we've left him alone: 
seems to have some understanding with Her Ladyship. I suppose he's no good to 
eat: she wouldn't worry about words from High Up. But a fine guard you keep in 
the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket. Early last night we saw 
him. Anyway my lads reported that Her Ladyship was having some fun, and that 
seemed good enough for me, until the message came. I thought her Sneak had 
brought her a toy. or that you'd perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war 
or something. I don't interfere when she's playing. Nothing gets by Shelob when 
she's on the hunt.'<BR>'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I 
tell you I'm not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did get by. It 
cut her web and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! 
'<BR>`Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? '<BR>`Got him? Got who? 
This little fellow? But if he was the only one then she'd have had him off to 
her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And if Lugburz wanted him, you'd 
have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there was more than one.'<BR>At this 
point Sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the 
stone.<BR>'Who cut the cords she'd put round him, Shagrat? Same one as cut the 
web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I 
reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? '<BR>Shagrat made no 
reply.<BR>`You may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. It's no 
laughing matter. No one, no one has ever stuck a pin in Shelob before, as you 
should know well enough. There's no grief in that; but think-there's someone 
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever 
walked since the bad old times, since the Great Siege. Something has 
slipped.'<BR>`And what is it then? ' growled Shagrat.<BR>`By all the signs, 
Captain Shagrat, I'd say there's a large warrior loose, Elf most likely, with an 
elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he's loose in your bounds, too, 
and you've never spotted him. Very funny indeed! ' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled 
grimly at this description of himself.<BR>'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy 
view.' said Shagrat. 'You can read the signs how you like, but there may be 
other ways to explain them. Anyhow. I've got watchers at every point, and I'm 
going to deal with one thing at a time. When I've had a look at the fellow we 
have caught, then I'll begin to worry about something else.'<BR>`It's my guess 
you won't find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. 'He may have had 
nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with the sharp sword 
doesn't seem to have thought him worth much anyhow – just left him lying: 
regular elvish trick.'<BR>`We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go 
and have a look at the prisoner!<BR>`What are you going to do with him? Don't 
forget I spotted him first. If there's any game, me and my lads must be in 
it.'<BR>'Now, now,' growled Shagrat. 'I have my orders. And it's more than my 
belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. Any trespasser found by the guard is to 
be held at the tower. Prisoner is to be stripped. Full description of every 
article, garment, weapon, letter, ring. or trinket is to be sent to Lugburz at 
once, and to Lugburz only. And the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact, under 
pain of death for every member of the guard, until He sends or comes Himself. 
That's plain enough, and that's what I'm going to do.'<BR>'Stripped, eh? ' said 
Gorbag. 'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? '<BR>`No, none of that. He's for 
Lugburz, I tell you. He's wanted safe and whole.'<BR>'You'll find that 
difficult,' laughed Gorbag. 'He's nothing but carrion now. What Lugburz will do 
with such stuff I can't guess. He might as well go in the pot.'<BR>'You fool,' 
snarled Shagrat. 'You've been talking very clever, but there's a lot you don't 
know, though most other folk do. You'll be for the pot or for Shelob, if you 
don't take care. Carrion! Is that all you know of Her Ladyship? When she binds 
with cords, she's after meat. She doesn't eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. 
This fellow isn't dead! '/.../<BR>`Garn!' said Shagrat. 'She's got more than one 
poison. When she's hunting, she just gives 'em a dab in the neck and they go as 
limp as boned fish, and then she has her way with them. D'you remember old 
Ufthak? We lost him for days. Then we found him in a corner; hanging up he was, 
but he was wide awake and glaring. How we laughed! She'd forgotten him, maybe, 
but we didn't touch him-no good interfering with Her. Nar – this little filth, 
he'll wake up, in a few hours; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit, he'll be 
all right. Or would be, if Lugburz would let him alone. And of course, beyond 
wondering where he is and what's happened to him.'<BR>'And what's going to 
happen to him,' laughed Gorbag. 'We can tell him a few stories at any rate, if 
we can't do anything else. I don't suppose he's ever been in lovely Lugburz, so 
he may like to know what to expect. This is going to be more funny than I 
thought. Let's go!'<BR>`There's going to be no fun, I tell you,' said Shagrat. 
'And he's got to be kept safe, or we're all as good as dead.'<BR>`All right! But 
if I were you, I'd catch the big one that's loose, before you send in any report 
to Lugburz. It won't sound too pretty to say you've caught the kitten and let 
the cat escape.'<BR>The voices began to move away. /.../
<P align=justify>He was catching 
the two Orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite 
close.<BR>`That's what I'm going to do,' said Shagrat in angry tones. 'Put him 
right up in the top chamber.'<BR>`What for? ' growled Gorbag. `Haven't you any 
lock-ups down below? '<BR>`He's going out of harm's way, I tell you,' answered 
Shagrat. 'See? He's precious. I don't trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor 
you neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I want him, and where you 
won't come, if you don't keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He'll be safe 
there.'

there was a tumult of fierce cries. Horsemen of the enemy swept up. The lines of 
fire became flowing torrents, file upon file of Orcs bearing flames, and wild

<BR>‘There is no news of the Rohirrim,’ he said. ‘Rohan will not 
come now. Or if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had 
tidings of has come first, from over the River by way of Andros, it is said. 
They are strong: battalions of Orcs of the Eye, and countless companies of Men 
of a new sort that we have not met before. Not tall, but broad and grim, bearded 
like dwarves, wielding great axes. Out of some savage land in the wide East they 
come, we deem’.

<BR>LotR. 5:4. The Siege of Gondor.<BR>Busy as ants 
hurrying orcs were digging, digging lines of deep trenches in a huge ring, just 
out of bowshot from the walls; and as the trenches were made each was filled 
with fire, though how it was kindled or fed, by art or devilry, none could see. 
All day the labour went forward, while the men of Minas Tirith looked on, unable 
to hinder it. And as each length of trench was completed, they could see great 
wains approaching; and soon yet more companies of the enemy were swiftly setting 
up, each behind the cover of a trench, great engines for the casting of 
missiles. There were none upon the City walls large enough to reach so far or to 
stay the work.

<BR>‘No, father of Horse-men,’ he said, ‘we fight not. Hunt only. Kill gorgun in woods, 
hate orc-folk. You hate gorgun too. We help as we can. Wild Men have long ears 
and long eyes; know all paths. Wild Men live here before Stone-houses; before 
Tall Men come up out of Water.’<BR>‘But our need is for aid in battle,’ said 
Eomer. ‘How will you and your folk help us?’<BR>‘Bring news,’ said the Wild Man. 
‘We look out from hills. We climb big mountain and look down. Stone-city is 
shut. Fire burns there outside; now inside too. You wish to come there? Then you 
must be quick. But gorgun and men out of far-away,’ he waved a short gnarled arm 
eastward, ‘sit on horse-road. Very many, more than Horse-men.’<BR>‘How do you 
know that?’ said Eomer.<BR>The old man’s flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, 
but his voice was sullen with displeasure. ‘Wild men are wild, free, but not 
children,’ he answered. ‘I am great headman, Ghan-buri-Ghan. I count many 
things: stars in sky, leaves on trees, men in the dark. You have a score of 
scores counted ten times and five. They have more. Big fight, and who will win? 
And many more walk round walls of Stone-houses.’<BR>‘Alas! he speaks all too 
shrewdly,’ said Theoden. ‘And our scouts say that they have cast trenches and 
stakes across the road. We cannot sweep them away in sudden onset.’<BR>‘And yet 
we need great haste,’ said Eomer. ‘Mundburg is on fire!’<BR>‘Let Ghan-buri-Ghan 
finish!’ said the Wild Man. ‘More than one road he knows. He will lead you by 
road where no pits are, no gorgun walk, only Wild Men and beasts. Many paths 
were made when Stonehouse-folk were stronger. They carved hills as hunters carve 
beast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate stone for food. They went through Druadan 
to Rimmon with great wains. They go no longer. Road is forgotten, but not by 
Wild Men. Over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass and tree, there 
behind Rimmon and down to Dоn, and back at the end to Horse-men’s road. Wild Men 
will show you that road. Then you will kill gorgun and drive away bad dark with 
bright iron, and Wild Men can go back to sleep in the wild woods.’<BR>Eomer and 
the king spoke together in their own tongue. At length Theoden turned to the 
Wild Man. ‘We will receive your offer,’ he said. ‘For though we leave a host of 
foes behind, what matter? If the Stone-city falls, then we shall have no 
returning. If it is saved, then the orc-host itself will be cut off. If you are 
faithful, Ghan-buri-Ghan, then we will give you rich reward, and you shall have 
the friendship of the Mark for ever.’<BR>‘Dead men are not friends to living 
men, and give them no gifts,’ said the Wild Man. ‘But if you live after the 
Darkness, then leave Wild Men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like 
beasts any more. Ghan-buri-Ghan will not lead you into trap. He will go himself 
with father of Horse-men, and if he leads you wrong, you will kill him.’<BR>‘So 
be it!’ said Theoden.

<P align=justify><b>Fr.299</b>
<BR>LotR. 6:1. The Tower 
of Cirith Ungol.<BR>At first Sam did not listen; he took a pace out of the 
eastward door and looked about. At once he saw that up here the fighting had 
been fiercest. All the court was choked with dead orcs or their severed and 
scattered heads and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl followed by a blow 
and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. An orc-voice rose in anger, and he 
knew it again at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was Shagrat speaking, Captain of 
the Tower.<BR>`You won’t go again, you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot! 
If you think I’m so damaged that it’s safe to flout me, you’re mistaken Come 
here, and I’ll squeeze your eyes out, like I did to Radbug just now. And when 
some new lads come, I’ll deal with you: I’ll send you to Shelob.’<BR>`They won’t 
come, not before you’re dead anyway,’ answered Snaga surlily. ‘I’ve told you 
twice that Gorbag’s swine got to the gate first, and none of ours got out. 
Lagduf and Muzgash ran through, but they were shot. I saw it from a window, I 
tell you. And they were the last.’<BR>‘Then you must go. I must stay here 
anyway. But I’m hurt. The Black Pits take that filthy rebel Gorbag!’ Shagrat’s 
voice trailed off into a string of foul names and curses. `I gave him better 
than I got, but he knifed me, the dung, before I throttled him. You must go, or 
I’ll eat you. News must get through to Lugburz, or we’ll both be for the Black 
Pits. Yes, you too. You won’t escape by skulking here.’<BR>`I’m not going down 
those stairs again,’ growled Snaga, `be you captain or no. Nar! Keep your hands 
off your knife, or I’ll put an arrow in your guts. You won’t be a captain long 
when They hear about all these goings-on. I’ve fought for the Tower against 
those stinking Morgul-rats, but a nice mess you two precious captains have made 
of things, fighting over the swag.’<BR>‘That’s enough from you,’ snarled 
Shagrat. `I had my orders. It was Gorbag started it, trying to pinch that pretty 
shirt.’<BR>`Well, you put his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had more 
sense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the most dangerous of 
these spies was still loose, and you wouldn’t listen. And you won’t listen now. 
Gorbag was right, I tell you. There’s a great fighter about, one of those 
bloody-handed Elves, or one of the filthy tarks /«The Men of Gondor» in Orkish, 
from elv.-adun ‘tarkil’/. He’s coming here, I tell you. You heard the bell. He’s 
got past the Watchers, and that’s tark’s work. He’s on the stairs. And until 
he’s off them, I’m not going down. Not if you were a Nazgul, I wouldn’t.’<BR>`So 
that’s it, is it?’ yelled Shagrat. ‘You’ll do this, and you’ll not do that? And 
when he does come, you’ll bolt and leave me? No, you won’t! I’ll put red 
maggot-holes in your belly first.’<BR>Out of the turret-door the smaller orc 
came flying. Behind him came Shagrat, a large orc with long arms that, as he ran 
crouching, reached to the ground. But one arm hung limp and seemed to be 
bleeding; the other hugged a large black bundle. In the red glare Sam, cowering 
behind the stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was 
scored as if by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver dripped from its 
protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal.<BR>As far as Sam could see, 
Shagrat hunted Snaga round the roof, until ducking and eluding him the smaller 
orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared. Then Shagrat 
halted. Out of the eastward door Sam could see him now by the parapet, panting, 
his left claw clenching and unclenching feebly. He put the bundle on the floor 
and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it. Going to the 
parapet he leaned over, looking down into the outer court far below. Twice he 
shouted but no answer came.<BR>Suddenly, as Shagrat was stooped over the 
battlement, his back to the roof-top, Sam to his amazement saw that one of the 
sprawling bodies was moving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched the 
bundle. It staggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a 
short broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that very moment 
a hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. Quick as a snake Shagrat 
slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy’s 
throat.<BR>`Got you, Gorbag!’ he cried. ‘Not quite dead, eh? Well, I’ll finish 
my job now.’ He sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and trampled it in his 
fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. Satisfied at 
last, he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph. 
Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and catching up the 
bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.<BR>Sam had no time to 
think. He might have slipped out of the other door, but hardly without being 
seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this hideous orc for long. 
He did what was probably the best thing he could have done. He sprang out to 
meet Shagrat with a shout. He was no longer holding the Ring, but it was there, 
a hidden power, a cowing menace to the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was 
Sting, and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars 
in the terrible elf-countries, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his 
kind. And Shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. He 
stopped, growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt 
aside, and as Sam sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and 
weapon, he thrust it hard into his enemy’s face. Sam staggered, and before he 
could recover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs.<BR>Sam ran after him, 
cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought of Frodo returned to him, and 
he remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret. Here was another 
dreadful choice, and he had no time to ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would 
soon get help and come back. But if Sam pursued him, the other orc might do some 
horrible deed up there. And anyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. 
He turned quickly and ran back up the stairs. `Wrong again, I expect,’ he 
sighed. `But it’s my job to go right up to the top first, whatever happens 
afterwards.’<BR>Away below Shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the 
court and through the gate, bearing his precious burden.

<BR>LotR. 6:1. The Tower of Cirith Ungol.
<BR>The door closed with a dull thud; and then a 
snarling orc-voice rang out.<BR>‘Ho la! You up there, you dunghill rat! Stop 
your squeaking, or I’ll come and deal with you. D’you hear?’<BR>There was no 
answer.<BR>‘All right,’ growled Snaga. `But I’ll come and have a look at you all 
the same, and see what you’re up to.’<BR>The hinges creaked again, and Sam, now 
peering over the corner of the passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an 
open doorway, and the dim shape of an orc coming out. He seemed to be carrying a 
ladder. Suddenly the answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached by a 
trap-door in the roof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder upwards, steadied 
it, and then clambered out of sight. Sam heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard 
the hideous voice speaking again.<BR>`You lie quiet, or you’ll pay for it! 
You’ve not got long to live in peace, I guess; but if you don’t want the fun to 
begin right now, keep your trap shut, see? There’s a reminder for you!’ There 
was a sound like the crack of a whip.<BR>At that rage blazed in Sam’s heart to a 
sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, and went up the ladder like a cat. His head came 
out in the middle of the floor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from 
its roof; the westward window-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on the 
floor by the wall under the window, but over it a black orc-shape was straddled. 
It raised a whip a second time, but the blow never fell.<BR>With a cry Sam leapt 
across the floor, Sting in hand. The orc wheeled round, but before it could make 
a move Sam slashed its whip-hand from its arm. Howling with pain and fear but 
desperate the orc charged head-down at him. Sam’s next blow went wide, and 
thrown off his balance he fell backwards, clutching at the orc as it stumbled 
over him. Before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its 
wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen through the open 
trap-door.<P align=justify>

<BR>He opened the bundle. Frodo 
looked in disgust at the contents, but there was nothing for it: he had to put 
the things on, or go naked. There were long hairy breeches of some unclean 
beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a 
coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and 
heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a 
broad-bladed stabbing-sword. Sam had brought several orc-helmets. One of them 
fitted Frodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with 
leather upon which the evil Eye was painted in red above the beaklike 
nose-guard.
<BR>`The Morgul-stuff, Gorbag’s gear, was a better fit and better 
made,’ said Sam; `but it wouldn’t do, I guess, to go carrying his tokens into 
Mordor, not after this business here. Well, there you are, Mr. Frodo. A perfect 
little orc, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could cover your 
face with a mask, give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. This will hide 
some of the tell-tales.’ He put a large black cloak round Frodo’s shoulders.

<BR>Don’t orcs eat, and don’t they drink? Or do 
they just live on foul air and poison?’<BR>`No, they eat and drink, Sam. The 
Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its 
own. I don’t think it gave life to the orcs, it only ruined them and twisted 
them; and if they are to live at all, they have to live like other living 
creatures. Foul waters and foul meats they’ll take, if they can get no better, 
but not poison. They’ve fed me, and so I’m better off than you. There must be 
food and water somewhere in this place.’

<BR>Hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small 
orc stopped. ‘Nar!’ it snarled. ‘I’m going home.’ It pointed across the valley 
to the orc-hold. ‘No good wearing my nose out on stones any more. There’s not a 
trace left, I say. I’ve lost the scent through giving way to you. It went up 
into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.’<BR>‘Not much use are you, you 
little snufflers?’ said the big orc. ‘I reckon eyes are better than your snotty 
noses.’<BR>‘Then what have you seen with them?’ snarled the other. ‘Garn! You 
don’t even know what you’re looking for.’<BR>‘Whose blame’s that?’ said the 
soldier. ‘Not mine. That comes from Higher Up. First they say it’s a great Elf 
in bright armour, then it’s a sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of 
rebel Uruk-hai; or maybe it’s all the lot together.’<BR>‘Ar!’ said the tracker. 
‘They’ve lost their heads, that’s what it is. And some of the bosses are going 
to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I hear is true: Tower raided and all, 
and hundreds of your lads done in, and prisoner got away. If that’s the way you 
fighters go on, small wonder there’s bad news from the battles.’<BR>‘Who says 
there’s bad news?’ shouted the soldier.<BR>‘Ar! Who says there 
isn’t?’<BR>‘That’s cursed rebel-talk, and I’ll stick you, if you don’t shut it 
down, see?’<BR>‘All right, all right!’ said the tracker. ‘I’ll say no more and 
go on thinking. But what’s the black sneak got to do with it all? That gobbler 
with the flapping hands?’<BR>‘I don’t know. Nothing, maybe. But he’s up to no 
good, nosing around, I’ll wager. Curse him! No sooner had he slipped us and run 
off than word came he’s wanted alive, wanted quick.’<BR>‘Well, I hope they get 
him and put him through it,’ growled the tracker. ‘He messed up the scent back 
there, pinching that cast-off mail-shirt that he found, and paddling all round 
the place before I could get there.’<BR>‘It saved his life anyhow,’ said the 
soldier. ‘Why, before I knew he was wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty 
paces right in the back; but he ran on.’<BR>‘Garn! You missed him,’ said the 
tracker. ‘First you shoot wild, then you run too slow, and then you send for the 
poor trackers. I’ve had enough of you.’ He loped off.<BR>‘You come back,’ 
shouted the soldier, ‘or I’ll report you!’<BR>‘Who to? Not to your precious 
Shagrat. He won’t be captain any more.’<BR>‘I’ll give your name and number to 
the Nazgul,’ said the soldier lowering his voice to a hiss. ‘One of them’s in 
charge at the Tower now.’<BR>The other halted, and his voice was full of fear 
and rage. ‘You cursed peaching sneakthief!’ he yelled. ‘You can’t do your job, 
and you can’t even stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may 
they freeze the flesh off you! If the enemy doesn’t get them first. They’ve done 
in Number One, I’ve heard, and I hope it’s true!’<BR>The big orc, spear in hand, 
leapt after him. But the tracker, springing behind a stone, put an arrow in his 
eye as he ran up, and he fell with a crash. The other ran off across the valley 
and disappeared.<BR>For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam 
stirred. ‘Well I call that neat as neat,’ he said. ‘If this nice friendliness 
would spread about in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.’<BR>‘Quietly, 
Sam,’ Frodo whispered. ‘There may be others about. We have evidently had a very 
narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than we guessed. But that 
is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to every corner of it. Orcs have 
always behaved like that, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. But 
you can’t get much hope out of it. They hate us far more, altogether and all the 
time. If those two had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel until 
we were dead.’

<BR>LotR. 6:2. The Land of Shadow<BR>They /Sam and 
Frodo/ did not have to wait long. The orcs were going at a great pace. Those in 
the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red flames in the dark, swiftly 
growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide his face when the 
torches reached them; and he set their shields before their knees to hide their 
feet.<BR>‘If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers 
alone and pass on!’ he thought.<BR>And so it seemed that they would. The leading 
orcs came loping along, panting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of 
the smaller breeds being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord’s wars; all they 
cared for was to get the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up 
and down the line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and 
shouting. File after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some 
way ahead. Sam held his breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then 
suddenly one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. He 
flicked a whip at them and yelled: ‘Hi, you! Get up!’ They did not answer, and 
with a shout he halted the whole company.<BR>‘Come on, you slugs!’ he cried. 
‘This is no time for slouching.’ He took a step towards them, and even in the 
gloom he recognized the devices on their shields. ‘Deserting, eh?’ he snarled. 
‘Or thinking of it? All your folk should have been inside Udun before yesterday 
evening. You know that. Up you get and fall in, or I’ll have your numbers and 
report you.’<BR>They struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like 
footsore soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. ‘No, not at 
the rear!’ the slave-driver shouted. ‘Three files up. And stay there, or you’ll 
know it, when I come down the line!’ He sent his long whip-lash cracking over 
their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company off again 
at a brisk trot.<BR>It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for 
Frodo it was a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop 
his mind from thinking, and he struggled on. The stench of the sweating orcs 
about him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and 
he bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and yet 
to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There was no 
hope of falling out unseen: Now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeered at 
them.<BR>‘There now!’ he laughed, flicking at their legs. ‘Where there’s a whip 
there’s a will, my slugs. Hold up! I’d give you a nice freshener now, only 
you’ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to your 
camp. Do you good. Don’t you know we’re at war?’<BR>They had gone some miles, 
and the road was at last running down a long slope into the plain, when Frodo’s 
strength began to give out and his will wavered. He lurched and stumbled. 
Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could 
himself hardly stay the pace much longer. At any moment now he knew that the end 
would come: his master would faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and 
their bitter efforts be in vain. ‘I’ll have that big slave-driving devil 
anyway,’ he thought.<BR>Then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his 
sword, there came an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and 
drawing near the entrance to Udun. Some way in front of it, before the gate at 
the bridge-end, the road from the west converged with others coming from the 
south, and from Barad-dur. Along all the roads troops were moving; for the 
Captains of the West were advancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his forces 
north. So it chanced that several companies came together at the road-meeting, 
in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. At once there was 
great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the 
ending of their march. Though the drivers yelled and plied their whips, scuffles 
broke out and some blades were drawn. A troop of heavy-armed uruks from 
Barad-dur charged into the Durthang line and threw them into confusion.<BR>Dazed 
as he was with pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly at his chance, 
and threw himself to the ground, dragging Frodo down with him. Orcs fell over 
them, snarling and cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out 
of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further edge of 
the road. It had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide themselves in 
black night or fog, and it was banked up some feet above the level of the open 
land.

<BR>Frodo looked again towards the 
Mountain. ‘No,’ he said, ‘we shan’t need much on that road. And at its end 
nothing.’ Picking up his orc-shield he flung it away and threw his helmet after 
it. Then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy belt and let it fall to 
the ground, and the sheathed sword with it. The shreds of the black cloak he 
tore off and scattered.
<BR>‘There, I’ll be an orc no more,’ he cried, ‘and I’ll 
bear no weapon fair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!’

<BR>...the power of Mordor was 
scattering like dust in the wind. As when death smites the swollen brooding 
thing that inhabits their crawling hill and holds them all in sway, ants will 
wander witless and purposeless and then feebly die, so the creatures of Sauron, 
orc or troll or beast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some 
slew themselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in 
holes and dark lightless places far from hope. But the Men of Rhun and of Harad, 
Easterling and Southron, saw the ruin of their war and the great majesty and 
glory of the Captains of the West. And those that were deepest and longest in 
evil servitude, hating the West, and yet were men proud and bold, in their turn 
now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle. But the most part 
fled eastward as they could; and some cast their weapons down and sued for 
mercy.

<BR>...Old Took's great-granduncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a 
hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount 
Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul's head 
clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went 
down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf 
invented at the same moment.

<BR>Hobbit 4. Over Hill and Under Hill
<BR>Out jumped the 
goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you 
could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even 
for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you 
could say tinder and flint ....Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the 
goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out. It was deep, 
deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to living in the heart of the 
mountains can see through. The passages there were crossed and tangled in all 
directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest 
post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. 
The goblins were very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed 
in their horrible stony voices; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the 
troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished again and again for his nice 
bright hobbit-hole. Not for the last time.
<BR>Now there came a glimmer of a red 
light before them. The goblins began to sing, or croak, keeping time with the 
flap of their flat feet on the stone, and shaking their prisoners as 
well.
<BR><BR>Clap! Snap! the black crack!
<BR>Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!
<BR>And down down to Goblin-town
<BR>You go, my lad!
<BR><BR>Clash, crash! Crush, smash!
<BR>Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs!
<BR>Pound, pound, far 
underground!
<BR>Ho, ho! my lad!
<BR><BR>Swish, smack! Whip crack!
<BR>Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat!
<BR>Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,
<BR>While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh,
<BR>Round and round far underground
<BR>Below, my lad!
<BR><BR>It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and 
the crush, smash! and to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The general 
meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and 
whipped them with a swish, smack!, and set them running as fast as they could in 
front of them; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and 
bleating like anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern.
<BR>It was lit by a 
great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full of 
goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves 
(with poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips) came running in, 
while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. The ponies were 
already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and packages 
lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and 
fingered by goblins, and quarreled over by goblins.
<BR>I am afraid that was the 
last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy 
little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since his horse was not 
suitable for the mountain-paths. For goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys 
(and other much more dreadful things), and they are always hungry. Just now 
however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves. The goblins chained 
their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a line and 
dragged them to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the end 
of the row.
<BR>There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous 
goblin with a huge head, and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the 
axes and the bent swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and 
bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They 
can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take 
the trouble, though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, 
daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well, 
or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and slaves that have to 
work till they die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they 
invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the 
ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and 
engines and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their 
own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they 
had not advanced (as it is called) so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, 
no more than they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly 
and prosperous; in some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. 
But they had a special grudge against Thorin's people, because of the war which 
you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale; and anyway 
goblins don't care who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and 
the prisoners are not able to defend themselves.
<BR>"Who are these miserable 
persons?" said the Great Goblin.
<BR>"Dwarves, and this!" said one of the 
drivers, pulling at Bilbo's chain so that he fell forward onto his knees.
<BR>"We 
found them sheltering in our Front Porch."
<BR>"What do you mean by it?" said the 
Great Goblin turning to Thorin. "Up to no good, I'll warrant! Spying on the 
private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I shouldn't be surprised to 
learn! Murderers and friends of Elves, not unlikely! Come! What have you got to 
say?"
<BR>"Thorin the dwarf at your service!" he replied-it was merely a polite 
nothing. "Of the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all. We 
sheltered from a storm in what seemed a convenient cave and unused; nothing was 
further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in any way whatever." 
That was true enough!
<BR>"Urn!" said the Great Goblin. "So you say! Might I ask 
what you were doing up in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, 
and where you were going to? In fact I should like to know all about you. Not 
that it will do you much good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know too much about your 
folk already; but let's have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly 
uncomfortable for you!"
<BR>"We were on a journey to visit our relatives, our 
nephews and nieces, and first, second, and third cousins, and the other 
descendants of our grandfathers, who live on the East side of these truly 
hospitable mountains," said Thorin, not quite knowing what to say all at once in 
a moment, when obviously the exact truth would not do at all.
<BR>"He is a liar, 
O truly tremendous one!" said one of the drivers. "Several of our people were 
struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures to come below; 
and they are as dead as stones. Also he has not explained this!" He held out the 
sword which Thorin had worn, the sword which came from the Trolls' lair.
<BR>The 
Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his 
soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They knew the 
sword at once. It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair 
elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. 
They had called it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply 
Biter. They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.
<BR>"Murderers' and 
elf-friends!" the Great Goblin shouted. "Slash them! Beat them! Bite them! Gnash 
them! Take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let them see the 
light again!" He was in such a rage that he jumped off his seat and himself 
rushed at Thorin with his mouth open.
<BR>Just at that moment all the lights in 
the cavern went out, and the great fire went off poof! into a tower of blue 
glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that scattered piercing white sparks all 
among the goblins.
<BR>The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and 
jabbering; howls, growls and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were 
beyond description. Several hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly 
alive together would not have compared with it. The sparks were burning holes in 
the goblins, and the smoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick 
for even their eyes to see through. Soon they were falling over one another and 
rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking and fighting as if they had 
all gone mad.
<BR>Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw it go 
right through the Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his 
rage. He fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into 
the darkness.
<BR>/.../
<BR>This sword's name was Glamdring the Foe-hammer, if you 
remember. The goblins just called it Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if 
possible.
<BR>/.../
<BR>On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear 
goblin noises and horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come 
through. /.../ Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the 
way better (they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that 
do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and 
closer. Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet 
which seemed only just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be 
seen behind them in the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly 
tired.
<BR>/.../ 
<BR>At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with him. They 
turned a sharp corner. "About turn!" he shouted. "Draw your sword, 
Thorin!"
<BR>There was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. 
They came scurrying round the corner in full cry, and found Goblin-cleaver and 
Foe-hammer shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes. The ones in 
front dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed. The ones 
behind yelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running 
after them. "Biter and Beater!" they shrieked; and soon they were all in 
confusion, and most of them were hustling back the way they had come.<BR>It was 
quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that comer. By that time the 
dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the 
goblins' realm. When the goblins discovered that, they put out their torches and 
they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with 
the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, 
and with hardly any more noise than bats.
<BR>That is why neither Bilbo, nor the 
dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them coming. Nor did they see them. But they 
were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind.

5. Riddles in the Dark.
<A NAME="fr311a"></A><BR><BR><B>a.</B> But somehow /Bilbo/ he was comforted. It was 
rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in Gondolin for the goblin-wars of 
which so many songs had sung; and also he had noticed that such weapons made a 
great impression on goblins that came upon them suddenly.
<A NAME="fr311b"></A><BR><BR><B>b.</B> He /Gollum/ 
liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when he could get it; but he took care 
they never found him out. He just throttled them from behind, if they ever came 
down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was prowling about. 
They very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something unpleasant was 
lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They had come on the 
lake, when they were tunnelling down long ago, and they found they could go no 
further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there was no reason to 
go that way – unless the Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy for 
fish from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back.
<A NAME="fr311c"></A><BR><BR><B>c.</B> No 
one would see him /Gollum/, no one would notice him, till he had his fingers on 
their throat. Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small 
goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he 
wanted something softer.

<A NAME="fr311d"></A><BR><BR><B>d.</B> The passage was low and 
roughly made... "A bit low for goblins, at least for the big ones," thought 
Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones, the orcs of the mountains, go along 
at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground.
<A NAME="fr311e"></A><BR><BR><B>e.</B> Bilbo 
blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn 
swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and 
watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for 
anything.
<BR>They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it 
was an accident, or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it 
was not on his finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him.
<BR>A 
pang of fear and loss, like an echo of Gollum's misery, smote Bilbo, and 
forgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. And- 
there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The 
goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. They 
yelled twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.
<BR>"Where is it?" they cried.
<BR>"Go back up the passage!" some shouted.
<BR>"This way!" some yelled. "That way!" others yelled.
<BR>"Look out for the door," bellowed the 
captain.
<BR>Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and 
swore and ran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very 
angry. There was a terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance.
<BR>Bilbo was 
dreadfully frightened, but he had the sense to understand what had happened and 
to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-guards, and so get 
out of the way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to death, or caught by 
feel.
<BR>"I must get to the door, I must get to the door!" he kept on saying to 
himself, but it was a long time before he ventured to try. Then it was like a 
horrible game of blind-man's buff. The place was full of goblins running about, 
and the poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a 
goblin who could not make out what he had bumped into, scrambled away on all 
fours, slipped between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for 
the door.
<BR>It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. Bilbo 
struggled but he could not move it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He 
squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on 
the edge of the door and the door-post. He could see outside into the open air: 
there were a few steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; 
the sun came out from behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the 
door-but he could not get through.
<BR>Suddenly one of the goblins inside 
shouted: "There is a shadow by the door. Something is outside!"
<BR>Bilbo's heart 
jumped into his mouth. He gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in all 
directions. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down the 
steps like a goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass 
buttons on the doorstep.
<BR>Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and 
hallooing, and hunting among the trees. But they don't like the sun: it makes 
their legs wobble and their heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring 
on, slipping in and out of the shadow of the trees, running quick and quiet, and 
keeping out of the sun; so soon they went back grumbling and cursing to guard 
the door.

<BR>Hobbit 6. Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire
<A NAME="fr312a"></A><BR><B>a.</B> "Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark, 
everybody falling over bodies and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my 
head with Glamdring, and Thorin Was stabbing here there and everywhere with 
Orcrist... All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding flashes, and we saw the 
goblins running back yelping.
<A NAME="fr312b"></A><BR><BR><B>b.</B> "What shall we do, what shall we do!" he 
cried. "Escaping goblins to be caught by wolves!" he said, and it became a 
proverb, though we now say 'out of the frying-pan into the fire' in the same 
sort of uncomfortable situations.
<A NAME="fr312c"></A><BR><BR><B>c.</B> The Wargs and the goblins often helped 
one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far from their 
mountains, unless they are driven out and are looking for new homes, or are 
marching to war (which I am glad to say has not happened for a long while). But 
in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food or 
slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to help and shared the 
plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. Now it 
seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. The Wargs 
had come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. The reason, no doubt, 
was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves 
and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting.<BR>/.../ 
The Wargs dared not attack them /men of local/ if there were many together, or 
in the bright day. But now they had planned with the goblins' help to come by 
night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. If their plan had been 
carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all would have been 
killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as 
prisoners to their caves. /.../ The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding them 
here in their very meeting-place. They thought they were friends of the woodmen, 
and were come to spy on them, and would take news of their plans down into the 
valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a terrible 
battle instead of capturing prisoners and devouring people waked suddenly from 
their sleep. So the Wargs had no intention of going away and letting the people 
up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long before that, they 
said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; and goblins can 
climb trees, or cut them down.
<A NAME="fr312d"></A><BR><BR><B>d.</B> So though he could not see the people in 
the trees, he could make out the commotion among the wolves and see the tiny 
flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping come up faint from far beneath 
him. Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and helmets, as 
long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from their gate and wound 
into the wood.
<BR>Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But 
the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they 
were proud and strong and noble-hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear 
them. When they took any notice of them at all (which was seldom, for they did 
not eat such creatures ), they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to 
their caves, and stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. The goblins hated 
the eagles and feared them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them 
from the mountains.
<A NAME="fr312e"></A><BR><BR><B>e.</B> Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They 
thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they goon learned what had 
really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their 
spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of 
fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.
<BR>Some got 
all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the 
tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, 
until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire 
nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and 
dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the 
dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly 
in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was 
in Bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he 
could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a 
midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes 
stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.
<BR>He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song:
<BR><BR>Fifteen birds in five firtrees,
<BR>their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze!
<BR>But, funny little birds, they had no wings!
<BR>O what shall we do with the funny little things?
<BR>Roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot;
<BR>fry them, boil them and eat them hot?
<P align=justify>Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! 
Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your 
nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"
<BR>"Go away! little boys!" 
shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also naughty little boys 
that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them angry, and to show 
them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he 
was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing.
<BR><BR>Burn, burn tree and fern!
<BR>Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch
<BR>To light the night for our delight,
<BR>Ya hey!
<BR><BR>Bake and toast 'em, fry and roast 'em
<BR>till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;
<BR>till hair smells and skins crack,
<BR>fat melts, and bones black
<BR>in cinders lie
<BR>beneath the sky!
<BR><BR>So dwarves shall die,
<BR>and light the night for our delight,
<BR>Ya hey!
<BR>Ya-harri-heyl
<BR>Ya hoy!
<P align=justify>And with that Ya hoy! the flames were under Gandalf’s tree. In a 
moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches 
cracked.
<BR>Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour 
flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on 
high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, 
though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like 
a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.
<BR>Just at that moment the Lord of the 
Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.<BR>There 
was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the 
Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were 
with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and 
gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their 
heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of 
their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons 
tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, 
who were scrambling up now as far as ever they dared to go.
<BR>Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's legs, 
as Dori was borne off last of all; and they went together above the tumult and 
the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.
<BR>Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods. A 
few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battle-ground. The flames 
about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest 
branches.

<A NAME="fr313a"></A><BR><B>a.</B> /Ganfalf says to Beorn/ I followed down into the main hall, which was crowded with goblins. The

'even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do against so 
many?'
<A NAME="fr313b"></A><BR><BR><B>b.</B> He /Beorn/ picked up the hobbit and laughed: "Not eaten up by Wargs

<A NAME="fr313c"></A><BR><BR><B>c.</B> He /Beorn/ had found more than 
that: he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he 
had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves, 
and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also 
because of the burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the wizard's 
fire of many of his chief servants. So much they told him when he forced them, 
but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid 
of the whole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the 
mountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the 
men and creatures that lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering 
them.
<BR>"It was a good story, that of yours," said Beorn, "but I like it still 
better now I am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word. If 
you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you would take the word of no one that you 
did not know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I can only say that I

himself.
<BR>"What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?" asked Bilbo 
suddenly.

Hobbit 17. The Clouds Burst
<BR>"Halt!" cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and 
stood alone, with arms uplifted, between the advancing dwarves and the ranks 
awaiting them. "Halt!" he called in a voice like thunder, and his staff blazed 
forth with a flash like the lightning. "Dread has come upon you all! Alas! it 
has come more swiftly than I guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg /Son of 
Azog/ of the North is coming. O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria. Behold! 
the bats are above his army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon wolves and 
Wargs are in their train!"
<BR>...So began a battle that none had expected; and 
it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side 
were the Goblins and the wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and 
Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the 
Misty Mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to 
fury. Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, colonies and 
strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North. Tidings 
they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging 
and an arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by 
tunnel or under dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of 
the North, where was their capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep 
down in time of storm unawares upon the South. Then they learned of the death of 
Smaug, and joy was in their hearts: and they hastened night after night through 
the mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden from the North hard on the 
heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in 
the broken lands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How 
much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not expected this 
sudden assault.
<BR>This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking 
and with Bard; and with Dain, for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins 
were the foes of all, and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten. 
Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the 
Mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet 
this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the 
Mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there was no 
time for make any other plan, or to summon any help.
<BR>Soon the thunder passed, 
rolling away to the South-East; but the bat-cloud came, flying lower, over the 
shoulder of the Mountain, and whirled above them shutting out the light and 
filling them with dread.
<BR>"To the Mountain!" called Bard. "To the Mountain! 
Let us take our places while there is yet time!"
<BR>On the Southern spur, in its 
lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set; on the Eastern 
spur were men and dwarves. But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves 
climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon 
they could see the lands before the Mountain's feet black with a hurrying 
multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing 
into Dale. These were the swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and 
howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint 
of resistance, and many there fell before the rest drew back and fled to either 
side. As Gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had gathered behind the resisted 
vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving wildly up between the 
arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Their banners were countless, black 
and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder.
<BR>It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo's experiences, and the one which at the 
time he hated most – which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and 
most fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. 
Actually I must say he put on his ring early in the business, and vanished from 
sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is not a complete 
protection in a goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows and wild spears; 
but it does help in getting out of the way, and it prevents your head from being 
specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman.
<BR>The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their 
spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was 
the wrath of the hands that held them. As soon as the host of their enemies was 
dense in the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and each flickered 
as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a thousand of their 
spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks were 
stained black with goblin blood. Just as the goblins were recovering from the 
onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rose from across the valley a 
deep-throated roar. With cries of "Moria!" and "Dain, Dain!" the dwarves of the 
Iron Hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and beside 
them came the men of the Lake with long swords. Panic came upon the Goblins; and 
even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with 
renewed numbers. Already many of the goblins were flying back down the river to 
escape from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and 
rending the dead and the wounded. Victory seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on 
the heights above.
<BR>Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and 
already many were on the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down 
recklessly, heedless of those that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to 
attack the spurs from above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran 
down from the main mass of the Mountain in the centre; and the defenders had too 
few to bar the way for long. Victory now vanished from hope. They had only 
stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide.
<BR>Day drew on. The goblins 
gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs came ravening and with them 
came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of steel. Soon 
actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled 
about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the 
stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern spur, and yet giving 
slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern 
arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill.
<BR>Suddenly there was a great shout, 
and from the Gate came a trumpet call. They had forgotten Thorin! Part of the 
wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool. Out leapt the 
King under the Mountain, and his companions followed him. Hood and cloak were 
gone; they were in shining armour, and red light leapt from their eyes. In the 
gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire.
<BR>Rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on. leapt down to the 
falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. Wolf and rider fell or fled before 
them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm 
him.
<BR>"To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!" he cried, and his 
voice shook like a horn in the valley.
<BR>Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too came many of the Lake-men, for Bard 
could not restrain them; and out upon the other side came many of the spearmen 
of the elves. Once again the goblins were stricken in the valley; and they were 
piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous with their corpses. The Wargs were 
scattered and Thorin drove right against the bodyguards of Bolg. But he could 
not pierce their ranks. Already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men 
and many dwarves, and many a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages 
merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened his onset grew ever slower. His 
numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the attackers were 
attacked, and they were forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all 
about with goblins and wolves returning to the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg 
came howling against them, and drove in upon their ranks like waves upon cliffs 
of sand. Their friends could not help them, for the assault from the Mountain 
was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being 
slowly beaten down.
<BR>On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves-partly because there was more chance of 
escape from that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) 
because if he was going to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the 
whole to defend the Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on 
the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic 
before the end. That did not seem far off. "It will not be long now," thought 
Bilbo, "before the goblins win the Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven 
down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone 
through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, 
than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and 
Fili and Kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men 
and the merry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have 
always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not 
to say distressing. I wish I was well out of it."
<BR>The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden gleam in the gloom 
Bilbo looked round. He gave a great cry: he had seen a sight that made his heart 
leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against the distant glow.
<BR>"The Eagles! 
The Eagles!" he shouted. "The Eagles are coming!"
<A NAME="fr316b"></A><BR><BR><B>b.</B> Hobbit 18. The Return Journey
<BR>The Eagles had long had suspicion of the goblins' mustering; from 
their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid. 
So they too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the Misty 
Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down 
the gale in the nick of time. They it was who dislodged the goblins from the 
mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, or driving them down shrieking 
and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they had freed the 
Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at 
last to the help of the battle below.
<BR>But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered.
<BR>In that last hour Beorn himself had appeared – no one knew 
how or from where. He came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have 
grown almost to giant-size in his wrath. The roar of his voice was like drums 
and guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from his path like straws and 
feathers. He fell upon their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder through the 
ring. The dwarves were making a stand still about their lords upon a low rounded 
hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, 
and bore him out of the fray. Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, 
so that nothing could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He 
scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then 
dismay fell on the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left 
their enemies with the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and 
prevented most of them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them 
into the Running River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the 
marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last fugitives 
perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood-elves' realm were there 
slain, or drawn in to die in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said 
that three parts of the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and 
the mountains had peace for many a year.
<BR>Victory had been assured before the fall of night, but the pursuit was still on foot, when Bilbo returned to the 
camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously wounded.<BR>/.../ 
The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the 
deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so 
that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards 
in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and 
it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking 
bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, 
if less in size and strength. In their day the last goblins were hunted from the 
Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the 
Wild.

<BR>ATB. THE MEWLIPS.
<BR>/«Стихотворение, 
написанное Ширским хоббитом. Хотя, возможно, оно является чистым вымыслом, в 
стихотворении можно увидеть отголоски сведений о Мглистых («Мерлокских») горах,

Долгих Болот. Образ самих мьюлипов, возможно, отражает смутные слухи об орках» - 
RFCG, s.v. Mewlips, the/.
<BR><BR>The shadows where the Mewlips dwell
<BR>Are dark and wet as ink,
<BR>And slow and softly rings their bell,
<BR>As in the slime you sink.
<BR><BR>You sink into the slime, who dare
<BR>To knock upon their door,
<BR>While down the grinning gargoyles stare
<BR>And noisome waters pour.
<BR><BR>Beside the rotting river-strand
<BR>The drooping willows weep,
<BR>And gloomily the gorcrows stand
<BR>Croaking in their sleep.
<BR><BR>Over 
the Merlock Mountains a long and weary way,
<BR>In a mouldy valley where the trees are grey,
<BR>By a dark pool's borders without wind or tide,
<BR>Moonless and sunless, the Mewlips hide.
<BR><BR>The cellars where the Mewlips sit
<BR>Are deep and dank and cold
<BR>With single sickly candle lit;
<BR>And there they count their gold.
<BR><BR>Their walls are wet, their ceilings drip;
<BR>Their feet upon the floor
<BR>Go softly with a squish-flap-flip,
<BR>As they sidle to the door.
<BR><BR>They peep out slyly; through a crack
<BR>Their feeling fingers creep,
<BR>And when they've finished, in a sack
<BR>Your bones they lake to keep.
<BR><BR>Beyond the Merlock Mountains, a long and lonely road.
<BR>Through the spider-shadows and the marsh of Tode,
<BR>And through the wood of hanging trees and the gallows-weed,
<BR>You go to find the Mewlips — and the Mewlips feed.
